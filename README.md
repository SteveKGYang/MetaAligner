## News
ðŸ“¢ *Mar. 2, 2024* Full release of the test data for the IMHI benchmark.

## Introduction
This project presents our efforts towards effective and generalizable multi-objective
alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs).
Through this work, we make three main contributions: (1) we propose <em>MetaAligner</em>, the first policy-agnostic 
method for multi-objective preference alignment. It performs multi-objective alignment efficiently, without tuning the 
policy models or accessing their parameters. Experimental results show that <em>MetaAligner</em> outperforms previous 
alignment methods and higher stability; (2) we utilize <em>MetaAligner</em> to exert zero-shot preference alignment for
unseen objectives. To our knowledge, this work marks the first attempt at generalizable multi-objective preference 
alignment. Experimental results show that <em>MetaAligner</em> can simultaneously perform effective alignment for 6 
unseen objectives while maintaining performance on aligned objectives; (3) We examine <em>MetaAligner</em> on 3 
preference alignment datasets. Experimental results show that <em>MetaAligner</em> improves win rates on multiple 
objectives across 10 policy models, substantially enhancing responses of state-of-the-art foundation models such as 
GPT-3.5 and Claude-3.

[The <em>MetaAligner</em> Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17141)

## <em>MetaAligner</em> Model 

We provide the 9 model checkpoints evaluated in the <em>MetaAligner</em> paper:

- MetaAligner-UltraFeedback-([1.1B](https://huggingface.co/klyang/MentaLLaMA-33B-lora), 7B, 13B): This model is fine-tuned based on the Vicuna-33B 
foundation model and the full IMHI instruction tuning data. The training
data covers 8 mental health analysis tasks. The model can follow instructions to make accurate mental health analysis
and generate high-quality explanations for the predictions. Due to the limitation of computational resources,
we train the MentaLLaMA-33B model with the PeFT technique LoRA, which significantly reduced memory usage.

- MetaAligner-HH-RLHF-([1.1B](https://huggingface.co/MetaAligner/MetaAligner-HH-RLHF-1.1B), [7B](https://huggingface.co/MetaAligner/MetaAligner-HH-RLHF-7B), [13B](https://huggingface.co/MetaAligner/MetaAligner-HH-RLHF-1.1B)): This model is fine-tuned based on the Meta 
LLaMA2-chat-13B foundation model and the full IMHI instruction tuning data. The training
data covers 8 mental health analysis tasks. The model can follow instructions to make accurate mental health analysis
and generate high-quality explanations for the predictions. Due to the model size, the inference
are relatively slow.

- MetaAligner-IMHI-([1.1B](https://huggingface.co/klyang/MentaLLaMA-33B-lora), 7B, 13B): This model is fine-tuned based on the BART-large foundation model
and the full IMHI-completion data. The training data covers 8 mental health analysis tasks. The model cannot
follow instructions, but can make mental health analysis and generate explanations in a completion-based manner.
The smaller size of this model allows faster inference and easier deployment.


You can use the MentaLLaMA models in your Python project with the Hugging Face Transformers library. 
Here is a simple example of how to load the fully fine-tuned model:

```python
from transformers import LlamaTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH, device_map='auto')
```

In this example, LlamaTokenizer is used to load the tokenizer, and LlamaForCausalLM is used to load the model. The `device_map='auto'` argument is used to automatically
use the GPU if it's available. `MODEL_PATH` denotes your model save path.

After loading the models, you can generate a response. Here is an example:

```python
prompt = 'Consider this post: "work, it has been a stressful week! hope it gets better." Question: What is the stress cause of this post?'
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate
generate_ids = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=2048)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

Our running of these codes on MentaLLaMA-chat-13B gets the following response:

```
Answer: This post shows the stress cause related to work. Reasoning: The post explicitly mentions work as being stressful and expresses a hope that it gets better. This indicates that the poster is experiencing stress in relation to their work, suggesting that work is the primary cause of their stress in this instance.
```

For the MentaLLaMA-33B-lora model, since our model is based on the Vicuna-33B foundation model, you need to first download the Vicuna-33B model [here](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3), 
and put it under the `./vicuna-33B` dir. Then download the MentaLLaMA-33B-lora weights and put it under the `./MentaLLaMA-33B-lora` dir.

```python
from peft import AutoPeftModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
peft_model = AutoPeftModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./MentaLLaMA-33B-lora")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('./MentaLLaMA-33B-lora')
```

After loading the models, you can generate a response. Here is an example:

```python
input_data = ["Consider this post: I'm finally dead inside and I don't know how to feel about it Fear, Anger, Sadness... It's all gone. I just feel numb. Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?"]

inputs = tokenizer(input_data, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
input_ids = inputs.input_ids

generate_ids = peft_model.generate(**inputs, max_length=2048)

truc_ids = generate_ids[0][len(input_ids[0]) :]
response = tokenizer.decode(truc_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=False)
```

Our running of these codes on MentaLLaMA-33B-lora gets the following response:
```
Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster's statement expresses a sense of emotional numbness and a lack of emotional response. This is a common symptom of depression, as individuals with depression often experience a diminished ability to feel emotions. The poster also mentions feeling dead inside, which further suggests a lack of emotional connection and a sense of hopelessness, both of which are common in depression. Overall, the language used and the description of emotional numbness align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.
```

## The IMHI Dataset
We collect raw data from 10 existing datasets covering 8 mental health analysis tasks, and transfer them into
test data for interpretable mental health analysis. Statistic about the 10 test sets are as follows:

### Training data
We introduce IMHI, the first multi-task and multi-source instruction-tuning dataset for interpretable mental
health analysis on social media.
We currently release the training and evaluation data from the following sets: DR, dreaddit, SAD, MultiWD, and IRF. The instruction
data is put under
```
/train_data/instruction_data
```
The items are easy to follow: the `query` row denotes the question, and the `gpt-3.5-turbo` row 
denotes our modified and evaluated predictions and explanations from ChatGPT. `gpt-3.5-turbo` is used as
the golden response for evaluation.

To facilitate training on models with no instruction following ability, we also release part of the test data for 
IMHI-completion. The data is put under
```
/train_data/complete_data
```
The file layouts are the same with instruction tuning data.

### Evaluation Benchmark
We introduce the first holistic evaluation benchmark for interpretable mental health analysis with 19K test samples
. All test data have been released. The instruction
data is put under
```
/test_data/test_instruction
```
The items are easy to follow: the `query` row denotes the question, and the `gpt-3.5-turbo` row 
denotes our modified and evaluated predictions and explanations from ChatGPT. `gpt-3.5-turbo` is used as
the golden response for evaluation.

To facilitate test on models with no instruction following ability, we also release part of the test data for 
IMHI-completion. The data is put under
```
/test_data/test_complete
```
The file layouts are the same with instruction tuning data. 

## Model Evaluation

### Response Generation
To evaluate your trained model on the IMHI benchmark, first load your model and generate responses for all
test items. We use the Hugging Face Transformers library to load the model. For LLaMA-based models, you can
generate the responses with the following commands:
```
cd src
python IMHI.py --model_path MODEL_PATH --batch_size 8 --model_output_path OUTPUT_PATH --test_dataset IMHI --llama --cuda
```
`MODEL_PATH` and `OUTPUT_PATH` denote the model save path and the save path for generated responses. 
All generated responses will be put under `../model_output`. Some generated examples are shown in
```
./examples/response_generation_examples
```
You can also evaluate with the IMHI-completion
test set with the following commands:
```
cd src
python IMHI.py --model_path MODEL_PATH --batch_size 8 --model_output_path OUTPUT_PATH --test_dataset IMHI-completion --llama --cuda
```
You can also load models that are not based on LLaMA by removing the `--llama` argument.
In the generated examples, the `goldens` row denotes the reference explanations and the `generated_text`
row denotes the generated responses from your model.

### Correctness Evaluation
The first evaluation metric for our IMHI benchmark is to evaluate the classification correctness of the model
generations. If your model can generate very regular responses, a rule-based classifier can do well to assign
a label to each response. We provide a rule-based classifier in `IMHI.py` and you can use it during the response
generation process by adding the argument: `--rule_calculate` to your command. The classifier requires
the following template:

```
[label] Reasoning: [explanation]
```

However, as most LLMs are trained to generate diverse responses, a rule-based label classifier is impractical.
For example, MentaLLaMA can have the following response for an SAD query:
```
This post indicates that the poster's sister has tested positive for ovarian cancer and that the family is devastated. This suggests that the cause of stress in this situation is health issues, specifically the sister's diagnosis of ovarian cancer. The post does not mention any other potential stress causes, making health issues the most appropriate label in this case.
```
To solve this problem, in our [MentaLLaMA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13567) we train 10 neural 
network classifiers based on [MentalBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15621), one for each collected raw dataset. The classifiers are trained to
assign a classification label given the explanation. We release these 10 classifiers to facilitate future
evaluations on IMHI benchmark.

All trained models achieve over 95% accuracy on the IMHI test data. Before you assign the labels, make sure 
you have transferred your output files in the format of `/exmaples/response_generation_examples` and named
as `DATASET.csv`. Put all the output files you want to label under the same DATA_PATH dir. Then download 
the corresponding classifier models from the following links:

The models download links: [CAMS](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/CAMS), [CLP](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/CLP), [DR](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/DR),
[dreaddit](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/dreaddit), [Irf](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/Irf), [loneliness](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/loneliness), [MultiWD](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/MultiWD),
[SAD](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/SAD), [swmh](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/swmh), [t-sid](https://huggingface.co/Tianlin668/t-sid)

Put all downloaded models under a MODEL_PATH dir and name each model with its dataset. For example, the model
for DR dataset should be put under `/MODEL_PATH/DR`. Now you can obtain the labels using these models with the following commands:
```
cd src
python label_inference.py --model_path MODEL_PATH --data_path DATA_PATH --data_output_path OUTPUT_PATH --cuda
```
where `MODEL_PATH`, `DATA_PATH` denote your specified model and data dirs, and `OUTPUT_PATH` denotes your
output path. After processing, the output files should have the format as the examples in `/examples/label_data_examples`.
If you hope to calculate the metrics such as weight-F1 score and accuracy, add the argument `--calculate` to
the above command.
### Explanation Quality Evaluation
The second evaluation metric for the IMHI benchmark is to evaluate the quality of the generated explanations.
The results in our 
[evaluation paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03347) show that [BART-score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11520) is
moderately correlated with human annotations in 4 human evaluation aspects, and outperforms other automatic evaluation metrics. Therefore,
we utilize BART-score to evaluate the quality of the generated explanations. Specifically, you should first
generate responses using the `IMHI.py` script and obtain the response dir as in `examples/response_generation_examples`.
Firstly, download the [BART-score](https://github.com/neulab/BARTScore) directory and put it under `/src`, then
download the [BART-score checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_7JfF7KOInb7ZrxKHIigTMR4ChVET01m/view?usp=sharing).
Then score your responses with BART-score using the following commands:
```
cd src
python score.py --gen_dir_name DIR_NAME --score_method bart_score --cuda
```
`DIR_NAME` denotes the dir name of your geenrated responses and should be put under `../model_output`. 
We also provide other scoring methods. You can change `--score_method` to 'GPT3_score', 'bert_score', 'bleu', 'rouge'
to use these metrics. For [GPT-score](https://github.com/jinlanfu/GPTScore), you need to first download
the project and put it under `/src`.

## Human Annotations

We release our human annotations on AI-generated explanations to facilitate future research on aligning automatic evaluation
tools for interpretable mental health analysis. Based on these human evaluation results, we tested various existing
automatic evaluation metrics on correlation with human preferences. The results in our 
[evaluation paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03347) show that 
BART-score is moderately correlated with human annotations in all 4 aspects.

### Quality Evaluation
In our [evaluation paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03347), we manually labeled a subset of the AIGC results for the DR dataset in 4 aspects:
fluency, completeness, reliability, and overall. The annotations are released in this dir:
```
/human_evaluation/DR_annotation
```
where we labeled 163 ChatGPT-generated explanations for the depression detection dataset DR. The file `chatgpt_data.csv`
includes 121 explanations that correctly classified by ChatGPT. `chatgpt_false_data.csv`
includes 42 explanations that falsely classified by ChatGPT. We also include 121 explanations that correctly 
classified by InstructionGPT-3 in `gpt3_data.csv`.

### Expert-written Golden Explanations
In our [MentaLLaMA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13567), we invited one domain expert major in quantitative psychology
to write an explanation for 350 selected posts (35 posts for each raw dataset). The golden set is used to accurately
evaluate the explanation-generation ability of LLMs in an automatic manner. To facilitate future research, we
release the expert-written explanations for the following datasets: DR, dreaddit, SWMH, T-SID, SAD, CAMS, 
loneliness, MultiWD, and IRF (35 samples each). The data is released in this dir:
```
/human_evaluation/test_instruction_expert
```
The expert-written explanations are processed to follow the same format as other test datasets to facilitate
model evaluations. You can test your model on the expert-written golden explanations with similar commands
as in response generation. For example, you can test LLaMA-based models as follows:
```
cd src
python IMHI.py --model_path MODEL_PATH --batch_size 8 --model_output_path OUTPUT_PATH --test_dataset expert --llama --cuda
```

## Ethics and Impacts

### Broader Impacts

In this work, <em>MetaAligner</em> provides an effective and model-agnostic method for generalizable and expandable 
alignment of LLM outputs with multiple human expectations. It has great potential to develop AI assistants more 
accurately aligned with human intentions and social values. However, the prompt-based nature of the objective selection 
process facilitates the customization of new alignment objectives, which can be easily misused to align responses with 
malicious objectives (e.g. sexism, racism, suicide ideation) via adjusting the objective descriptions and utilizing the 
in-context learning ability of <em>MetaAligner</em>. These actions can lead to harmful outputs from <em>MetaAligner</em>
. As the authors of <em>MetaAligner</em>, we are dedicated to developing safe and fair AI technology to benefit the 
common welfare of our society. We condemn any malicious use of <em>MetaAligner</em> and advocate for its responsible 
and ethical applications. In addition, as <em>MetaAligner</em> performs alignment in a plug-and-play manner on top of 
the policy models, deployment of this technology can increase the overall inference cost of AI assistants and carbon 
emissions. These disadvantages can affect the long-term goals of developing
[green AI systems](https://towardsdatascience.com/green-ai-methods-and-solutions-to-improve-ai-sustainability-861d69dec658)
and 
[equitable access to AI](https://tappstr.medium.com/equitable-access-to-ai-bridging-the-digital-divide-for-inclusive-progress-b9c167fcee3)
to benefit all of humanity.

### Safeguards
This released codes, data, and <em>MetaAligner</em> models are provided for research only. None of the material 
constitutes actual diagnosis or advice, and help-seekers should get assistance from professional psychiatrists or 
clinical practitioners. No warranties, express or implied, are offered regarding the accuracy, completeness, or utility

consequences arising from the use of the information herein. Users should exercise their own judgment and consult 
professionals before making any clinical-related decisions. The use of the software and information contained in this 
paper is entirely at the user's own risk.

The collected queries to build our IMHI preference dataset are from the publicly available IMHI dataset
, and we strictly follow the privacy protocols and ethical principles to protect user privacy and guarantee that 
anonymity is properly applied in all the mental health-related texts. In addition, to minimize misuse, all examples 
provided in our paper are paraphrased and obfuscated utilizing the moderate disguising scheme.

In addition, recent studies have indicated LLMs may introduce some potential bias, such as gender gaps. Meanwhile, 
some incorrect prediction results, inappropriate explanations, and over-generalization also illustrate the potential 
risks of current LLMs. Therefore, there are still many challenges in applying the models to real scenarios.

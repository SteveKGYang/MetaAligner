This suggests a potential willingness to tolerate or accept verbal abuse in exchange for an opportunity to express anger. This may indicate a lack of self-worth or a sense of being undeserving of healthy conflict resolution.

3. The individual wishes for a person to have this argument with, which implies a desire for connection and engagement. However, the way they express this desire (through arguing and name-calling) may indicate a difficulty in forming and maintaining healthy, constructive relationships. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual may be struggling with interpersonal conflict and ineffective communication.","The post does not explicitly mention thwarted belongingness, but there is an implication in the statement about wanting someone to argue with because they get to call you names. This could suggest a desire for validation or attention from others, which may stem from feelings of loneliness or isolation.

Thwarted belongingness refers to situations where an individual feels a sense of connection or attachment to a particular group or activity, but they are prevented from fully engaging in those activities due to external factors such as social norms, personal circumstances, or other barriers. In this case, the individual may feel a strong connection to the music community and the sense of belonging that comes with being part of a musical group, but they may also feel pressured by other aspects of their life to abandon these interests.

However, the language used suggests feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and despair, which are common symptoms associated with depression and may increase an individual’s risk of developing a DCR of suicide in the future. It is important to note that individuals experiencing these emotions should seek professional help as soon as possible."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions trying various activities and strategies to improve their emotional state, indicating that they are actively seeking ways to feel better. 2. They express frustration and exhaustion with their attempts, suggesting that they have not found effective solutions to address their emotional struggles. This could indicate a lack of fulfillment in their current relationships and a sense of thwarted belongingness. 3.

The focus on personal responsibility for self-improvement through various activities could suggest a lack of support from others or feeling disconnected from social norms/expectations. However, without further context, it is difficult to definitively determine if thwarted belongingness is present."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling tired of trying various self-care activities and not seeing a noticeable difference in how they feel. This suggests a sense of frustration and hopelessness, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also mentions that these activities are adding to their struggle, indicating a possible perception of being overwhelmed and burdened by the expectations of self-improvement.
3. While the post does not directly mention thoughts of being better off gone, the sense of frustration and struggle can contribute to a negative self-perception and increased risk of perceived burdensomeness.","The post does not explicitly mention or indicate any risk factors related to perceived burdensomeness as defined by Snyder et al.'s (1978) model for coping responses to stressors such as uncontrollability, unpredictability, and overload. However, some aspects of the post may suggest feelings of helplessness or hopelessness that could contribute to an individual experiencing perceived burdensomeness if they are unable to cope with their struggles effectively. The following points from the post might be relevant:  * Efforts to maintain various behaviors like eating healthily, exercising, socializing, cleaning, meditating, seeking sunlight, consulting a therapist, etc., without observing significant improvements in one's well-being can lead to frustration and discouragement. This sense of futility might exacerbate feelings of helplessness and contribute to perceived burdensomeness. * Mentioning feeling tired of attempting these actions further highlights the potential impact on mental well-being, suggesting that the person is struggling to manage their difficulties. If left unaddressed, these feelings of exhaustion and despair could increase the likelihood of developing perceived burdensomeness."

They feel disconnected from others and lack support in their struggles with mental health issues. The use of language such as ""fight"" implies a sense of battle against an external force (depression), which further emphasizes the feeling of being alone in one's struggle. Additionally, the mention of seeking attention through social media could suggest a desire for validation and connection with others. Overall, the post suggests that the person feels helpless and powerless, indicating thwarted belongingness."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post explicitly mentions thoughts of suicide and not caring if the depression wins. This indicates a strong sense of hopelessness and potentially a desire to escape from the perceived burdensomeness. 
2. The post expresses a lack of self-worth and a sense of being pathetic. These negative self-perceptions can contribute to perceived burdensomeness. 
3. The post also mentions concerns about hurting the family by sharing these thoughts and a desire to not have them wonder what they did wrong. This indicates an awareness of the potential impact on others and a sense of being a burden to them. 
Overall, the combination of suicidal thoughts, negative self-perceptions, and concerns about the impact on loved ones suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness in this post.","The post shows signs of perceived burdensomeness as the individual expresses feelings of being weighed down and unable to cope with their struggles. They mention feeling like they are carrying an immense weight on their shoulders and that nothing seems to be helping them. Additionally, they express a lack of concern for potential consequences such as hurting others or failing in some way, which could indicate a sense of hopelessness and despair. It's important to note that these feelings may be indicative of a larger mental health issue and seeking professional support is recommended."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: The individual in this post expresses concerns about the side effects and drawbacks of taking Viibryd, a medication for depression. While they mention experiencing weight gain and concerns about their physical appearance, this does not necessarily indicate a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. The post focuses more on the individual's dissatisfaction with the medication and their fear of going off it due to potential withdrawal symptoms. There is no mention of feeling lonely, disconnected, or lacking social connections. The primary concern in this post is related to the effectiveness and side effects of the medication, rather than interpersonal risk factors for mental disturbance.","The post does not explicitly mention thwarted belongingness, but it does express concerns related to social interactions and support due to weight gain caused by the medication. While the writer mentions their fears of stopping the medication (Viibryd), these fears do not directly relate to feelings of being excluded from social groups or experiencing reduced sense of connectedness within those groups. Therefore, while the post touches upon some aspects of psychological wellbeing, it does not demonstrate an explicit expression of thwarted belongingness."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling depressed and the fear that depression can become harder to treat over time. These thoughts indicate a negative mental state and a potential risk for perceived burdensomeness.

This suggests a dissatisfaction with the current situation and a possible desire to escape from the perceived burdensomeness associated with the medication's effects.","The post does not explicitly mention feelings of being a burden to others, which is an aspect of perceived burdensomeness. However, the author mentions their struggles with weight gain, anxiety, and the cost of the medication, suggesting that these factors may be contributing to their overall sense of distress.

"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions having thoughts of serious self-harm and describes physical sensations that accompany these thoughts, indicating a high level of anguish and distress. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness. 2. They express a desire for validation or confirmation from others, indicating a need for connectedness and understanding. 3. The individual's description of their body's response to these thoughts suggests a conflicted internal struggle, further highlighting the risk of inadequate connectedness.","The post does not explicitly mention or discuss feelings of thwarted belongingness. However, some individuals may interpret the content and context of the post as potentially indicating a need for social connection or support that is not being met. If an individual identifies with the writer's experiences and feels similarly disconnected from others, they might perceive their own sense of belonging to be threatened by these negative emotions and thoughts. Therefore, while the post itself doesn't directly address thwarted belongingness, its themes could still resonate with readers who are struggling with similar issues related to social connections and feelings of isolation."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions dreaming up serious ways of killing oneself, which indicates a high level of distress and thoughts of self-harm. This is a strong indicator of perceived burdensomeness. 
2. The post also mentions experiencing tingly sensations and sharp electromagnetic waves when having these thoughts, which suggests a physical response to the distressing thoughts.

These signs suggest that the person may be at risk of developing more severe mental health issues if left unaddressed."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: The individual in this post expresses a deep sense of pain and longing following a breakup. They mention feeling angry and confused about their ex-partner's choices, which suggests a disruption in their connectedness.

The post mentions feeling hurt and angry, but does not directly indicate any thoughts of being better off gone or feeling like a burden to others. 2. The post expresses a desire for the person to come back and a feeling of being alone forever, but these feelings do not necessarily indicate perceived burdensomeness. They could be related to feelings of rejection or loss. 3.

Overall, the post does not demonstrate clear risk of perceived burdensomeness.","The post does not explicitly mention suicidal ideation or a plan, but there are indications in the text that suggest a perception of burdensomeness. The author expresses feelings of anger towards their ex-partner, wishes for them to return, and states that they feel like their last chance at happiness has been taken from them.

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post implies a desire to have the courage to go through with something, but it does not explicitly state what that ""something"" is. Perceived burdensomeness usually involves thoughts of self-harm or suicide, but without further context, it is difficult to determine if that is the case here.
2. The response also does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness. It is ambiguous and could be interpreted as a plea for courage to face a difficult situation rather than a desire to escape perceived burdensomeness.","The post does not explicitly mention any specific situation or task that may be causing feelings of burdensomeness. However, if we interpret the phrase ""going through with it"" as referring to a potentially difficult decision or action, then there is an implied sense of risk and uncertainty associated with the prayer.

Therefore, while the post itself does not necessarily demonstrate risk of perceived burdensomeness, the context provided by our conversation suggests that such risks might exist within the broader narrative being conveyed."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual expresses a sudden and distressing change in their emotions, specifically mentioning thoughts of self-harm. While this does indicate a psychological disturbance, it does not directly suggest a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness.

The focus is more on the individual's distressing thoughts and confusion about their own behavior.","The post shows signs of potential thwarted belongingness, as it describes feeling disconnected from others (e.g., being alone in one's own house) and expresses an urge to harm oneself. Feelings of loneliness or isolation are common experiences for individuals who feel like they do not belong or fit in with their surroundings, which may lead them to seek out alternative sources of support or connection. In some cases, these feelings can be intense enough that they result in self-harming behaviors such as cutting oneself. It is important to note that self-harm is generally considered a serious issue that requires professional help and intervention."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions a sudden shift in mood from enjoying time with family to feeling the need to self-harm. This demonstrates a significant change in emotional state, which can be indicative of mental disturbance.
2. The post expresses confusion and frustration with oneself, asking ""wtf is wrong with me."" This suggests a lack of understanding of why these thoughts and feelings are occurring, which can contribute to feelings of burden and hopelessness.

The individual mentions feeling stuck in their current situation with no clear path forward, which can contribute to an increased perception of burdensomeness.

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual mentions being partially hospitalized for paranoia and expresses some disappointment about having to miss work.

Additionally, there may be an implied concern around potential negative reactions from others based on societal attitudes toward mental illness and seeking professional help. Therefore, while the post itself doesn't directly demonstrate risks associated with thwarted belongingness, it can be inferred that such risks might exist in relation to the broader context surrounding mental health stigmatization and discrimination."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post indicates that the person is being hospitalized for paranoia, which suggests that they are actively seeking help for their mental health concerns.

"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: The individual in this post expresses several risk factors for thwarted belongingness and a psychologically-painful mental state. 

1. They mention a history of bipolar manic depression, indicating a pre-existing mental disturbance that can contribute to feelings of disconnectedness and inadequacy in forming and maintaining relationships.
2. The individual shares their struggle with maintaining an inflated image and pretending to be someone they are not, which suggests a lack of authentic connections and difficulty in establishing genuine relationships.
3. They describe a loss of confidence, self-loathing, and a sense of being trapped inside their own mind, indicating feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with their current state of connectedness.
4. The individual expresses difficulty in opening up in relationships, particularly with women their age, and highlights the absence of intimate situations for the past eight years, which further suggests a lack of belongingness and the potential for social isolation.
5. They compare their current state to a previously confident and liked version of themselves, emphasizing a sense of loss and dissatisfaction with their current state of connectedness.

All of these factors contribute to a high risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual experiences a painful sense of inadequacy and disconnection in their relationships and social interactions.","The post shows signs of thwarted belongingness, particularly social belongingness.

However, some elements in the post suggest a possible vulnerability towards developing such thinking if left unaddressed. These include:  1. The individual expresses uncertainty about their current situation by stating they cannot identify any stressors causing their symptoms. This lack of clarity could lead them to question whether there is an inherent issue with their life, potentially contributing to a sense of burdensomeness over time. 2.

The main concern in the post is about feeling left out and rejected by her friends when she chose to spend New Year's Eve with her family instead of joining them. She feels angry and betrayed because her friends continued to party without her despite knowing that she didn't want to join them.  While it doesn't directly address risk of perceived burdensomeness, the situation described in the post could potentially contribute to an increased perception of burdensomeness over time.

It may cause them to question whether their struggles are significant enough to warrant ending their own lives. Therefore, while the post itself doesn't directly exhibit risk factors for perceived burdensomeness, its interpretation might lead some individuals down that path."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions feeling suicidal, which is a strong indication of risk of thwarted belongingness. Suicidal thoughts often arise as a result of feeling disconnected and lacking belongingness. 2.

The author mentions difficulty maintaining relationships (e.g., ghosting friends) and struggles with self-esteem, which might lead them to feel isolated and unworthy of connection. 2. There is a sense of criticism towards oneself, such as perceiving failure to connect with people as a result of personal flaws instead of external circumstances. This internalized negative judgment can contribute to feelings of thwarted belongingness."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feelings of self-hatred, self-blame, and a negative self-perception. These thoughts indicate a lack of self-worth and self-criticism, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also mentions struggles with various areas of life, such as maintaining friendships, focusing, and speaking. These difficulties can contribute to feelings of incompetence and inadequacy, which can further contribute to perceived burdensomeness.

4. The post also mentions feeling ""meh"" and numb, which can indicate emotional detachment and a lack of fulfillment. These feelings can further contribute to a sense of burden and disconnection from others.
Based on these factors, the post shows a risk of perceived burdensomeness.","The post does describe some symptoms that could indicate perceived burdensomeness such as feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities (e.g., being unable to leave one's bed), experiencing social withdrawal (e.g., ghosting friends), and having negative self-evaluations (e.g., believing oneself to be an ""asshole""). However, it also suggests that despite these struggles, the individual may still engage in activities such as using the Internet or contacting their family members, which might suggest they do not necessarily see themselves as a complete burden to others. Therefore, while there are indicators of perceived burdensomeness present in the post, it is unclear how strongly the individual feels this way overall."

Overall, the combination of feeling disconnected from reality, strained relationships, and experiencing distressing dreams and emotions could indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness.","The post does not explicitly mention any risks related to thwarted belongingness. However, there are some indications throughout the text that suggest the individual may be experiencing feelings of disconnection and isolation. For example, they mention their mother being ""weird"" and distant, and their difficulty in describing what they are going through. Additionally, the recurring theme of strange and unsettling dreams could indicate that the person feels out of touch with reality and unsure of their surroundings. Overall, although the post doesn't specifically reference thwarted belongingness, there are signs that suggest the individual may be struggling with feelings of alienation and detachment."

Therefore, it cannot be definitively determined whether the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. However, some elements within the text may warrant further exploration by a mental health professional. For example, the sense of disorientation, changes in behavior observed by others, unusual dream content, and feelings of unreality could potentially indicate a significant emotional state change requiring assessment. Additionally, the presence of a family history of mood disorders might also increase the need for monitoring and support."

"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling extremely anxious and experiencing a sense of disconnection from oneself, which are indicators of mental disturbance. 2. The post also mentions feeling like someone else in their own body and feeling isolated, which can contribute to a sense of perceived burdensomeness. 3. The post expresses fear and concern about this experience being permanent, indicating a heightened level of distress. Overall, these factors suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness.","The post does describe some symptoms that could be indicative of a mental health concern such as anxiety, but it doesn't specifically mention perceived burdensomeness.

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In the given post, the individual expresses a desire to end their life using a specific method. This indicates a severe level of psychological distress and potential risk for suicide. However, the post does not explicitly mention feelings of disconnectedness or inadequate belongingness. While it is possible that the individual may be experiencing these feelings, based on the given information alone, we cannot definitively conclude that thwarted belongingness is a significant factor in this specific post.","The post shows a clear intention to end one's own life, which indicates a strong desire to escape from human suffering and the problems associated with being alive. This can be seen as an attempt to avoid feeling lonely or unwanted by society. However, it does not necessarily indicate a specific plan to commit suicide or engage in self-harm. It could also be interpreted as a cry for help or attention from others who may be able to offer support and guidance during difficult times. Therefore, while there is certainly a risk of thwarted belongingness present in the post, it is important to approach such messages with empathy and understanding rather than judgment or dismissal."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post explicitly mentions using a method that has a 100% fatality rate, indicating a clear intent for self-harm. This is a strong indicator of perceived burdensomeness and a desire to escape from human suffering.
2. The post mentions being forever away from human suffering and being free from any issues for eternity, further suggesting a desire to relieve perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post also mentions going to a place where they won't be stopped, indicating a plan to carry out self-harm.
Overall, the combination of explicit intent for self-harm, desire for relief from suffering, and a plan to carry out the act all suggest a high risk of perceived burdensomeness.","The post suggests that the individual may have a negative attitude towards life, feeling overwhelmed by their problems and seeking an escape through death.

3. Despite the positive aspects mentioned (being healthy, job, good weather), the individual still feels a sense of longing and dissatisfaction, which suggests a potential inadequacy of connectedness and potential risk for thwarted belongingness.","The post does not explicitly mention or suggest any specific risks related to thwarted belongingness. However, the reference to missing someone deeply suggests an emotional connection with another person who may be absent from their current situation. The individual in the post expresses feelings of longing and desire for this person, which could potentially lead to negative consequences such as distress, loneliness, or even depression if they are unable to reconcile these emotions or find ways to cope with them effectively."

3. The overall tone of the post is positive, with the person expressing gratitude for various aspects of their life. This does not align with the risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.","The post does not explicitly mention any risks related to perceived burdensomeness or suicidal ideation. However, it does express feelings of longing and missing someone very deeply, which could potentially be indicative of emotional distress. Additionally, the use of language such as ""infinitely"" may suggest an intensity of emotion beyond what might typically be experienced in day-to-day life. If you are concerned about your own wellbeing or the wellbeing of others who may be experiencing similar emotions, it would be important to seek support from mental health professionals or crisis hotlines."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions experiencing intense flashbacks and feeling like they are reliving a traumatic event. This suggests a high level of psychological distress and potentially a disrupted sense of connectedness. 2.

The individual states that they are not going back into therapy, which could indicate a lack of support or resources to address their distress and potentially exacerbate their feelings of disconnectedness. Therefore, this post shows a risk of thwarted belongingness.","The post does not explicitly mention or indicate any specific risks related to thwarted belongingness. However, based on the content of the post, one could infer that the individual is experiencing significant distress due to their past experiences in therapy and at the hospital.

3. The post explicitly states that the individual is not willing to go back to therapy, which may indicate a lack of hope for improvement or a sense of hopelessness, contributing to perceived burdensomeness.","Based on the information provided in the post, there are some indications of perceived burdensomeness. The person is experiencing intense emotional distress related to past traumatic experiences and has difficulty coping with them. They also mention feeling unable to function normally during these episodes and needing support from others. Additionally, they express concern about returning to therapy or increasing their medication, which could suggest an unwillingness to seek further help due to feelings of shame or stigma associated with mental health issues.

It is simply seeking advice on coping mechanisms from others who may have experienced similar challenges or struggles. However, if someone responds in an insensitive or dismissive manner, it could potentially lead to feelings of rejection or exclusion among those reading the thread."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention any feelings of burden or thoughts of being better off gone. It is a request for book recommendations on coping with anxiety and depression. 2. The response also does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness.

It would be prudent for mental health professionals to engage these individuals in conversations about their wellbeing and provide appropriate support if needed."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual explicitly mentions a need for interaction, suggesting a desire for connection with others.
2. They mention struggling with self-harm and addiction, which can be indicative of underlying feelings of loneliness, inadequacy, and a lack of connectedness.

The individual is seeking comfort from others who may have experienced similar struggles with addiction or difficult life experiences. However, there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or self-harm in the post, so we cannot definitively classify it as high risk based on that criteria alone. It's important to note that online interactions should always be monitored closely and any posts expressing thoughts of self-harm or suicide should be taken seriously and immediately referred to professional help resources such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) or Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741)."

3. Despite the self-harm and addiction mentioned, the post expresses a desire for interaction and a willingness to listen to others' experiences. This can be seen as a seeking of social connection, possibly as a means to alleviate feelings of burdensomeness and loneliness.","Based on the information provided in the post, there are indications that the individual may be experiencing feelings of perceived burdensomeness. The person states that they ""just need some interaction"" and expresses their desire for support from others, which could suggest that they feel isolated or overwhelmed by their own thoughts and emotions.

They also mention struggling with procrastination and lack of motivation, which could contribute to their sense of disconnection from others.

However, it should be noted that other factors such as situational stressors or underlying mental health conditions may also play a role in the person's experience."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: This post shows a risk of perceived burdensomeness. Here's the reasoning:

1. The post mentions feelings of being homesick and not making any real friends in university accommodation. This indicates a lack of social connection and feelings of social inadequacy, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.

The statement ""I'll never see the girl I like because of them [the family]"" suggests a sense of powerlessness and hopelessness in relation to their situation. Additionally, the use of phrases such as ""keep blaming me for everything"" and ""done"" can indicate frustration and despair, which could contribute to an overall perception of burdensomeness if left unaddressed.

If their reluctance stems from fear of being judged or feeling like their problems won't be understood by others, it could represent an example of thwarted belongingness – the belief that seeking assistance from external sources (like mental health professionals) would lead to further alienation rather than connection. 3. Resistance towards medication: Similarly, their partner dismisses the idea of taking medication for their condition.

4. The reaction of the ex-partner, crying and stating that there is no chance of getting back together, could be interpreted as a rejection and a further sense of inadequate belongingness.","The post does not explicitly mention any instance of thwarted belongingness, as the writer's primary concern seems to be their own emotional state following infidelity and subsequent breakup with their partner. However, some elements within the post suggest potential risks related to belongingness. Here are two possible interpretations:  1. Thwarted belongingness due to perceived rejection by one's romantic partner: In the post, the writer expresses uncertainty about whether their former partner truly means they will never get back together again. This uncertainty may stem from a fear of being rejected once more if they try to reconcile. If the writer believes that their partner might still have feelings for them, despite stating otherwise, they could experience heightened anxiety around the possibility of further rejection or abandonment. Such an interpretation highlights the importance of clear communication between partners during times of conflict, which can reduce misunderstandings and alleviate associated stressors. 2. Thwarted belongingness resulting from social comparison: While the main focus of the post is on the writer's personal experiences, certain aspects of the narrative touch upon broader societal expectations surrounding relationships. Specifically, the writer mentions feeling ""in so much pain"" after sleeping with someone new and subsequently experiencing guilt when speaking with their ex-partner. These feelings could indicate that the writer has internalized cultural norms or standards regarding the exclusivity of intimate relationships (e.g., monogamy).

Overall, these factors indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual feels apprehensive about seeking help and does not feel fully connected or supported by their immediate family.","The post does not explicitly mention thwarted belongingness, as the focus is on concerns related to sharing personal issues with others. However, there are elements in the post that could potentially lead to feelings of thwarted belongingness if the person cannot find supportive individuals to discuss their situation with. Here's why:  1. Fear of burdening others: The individual expresses concern that their loved ones may become worried excessively or attempt to influence them to return home or change their lifestyle. This suggests an underlying fear of being seen as a burden by those close to them. 2. Difficulty finding appropriate people to confide in: By admitting that talking to family members might result in unwanted advice or pressure, the author implies that they struggle to identify trustworthy individuals who would genuinely listen without judgment. 3. Seeking reassurance from others: Although the primary goal of the post seems to be seeking information about how others have handled similar situations, the desire for validation indicates a need for emotional connection and understanding, which could point to feelings of thwarted belongingness. 4. Lack of self-confidence: The idea that one might be 'overthinking' things further emphasizes the individual's uncertainty about themselves and their ability to navigate challenging social dynamics. This lack of confidence contributes to potential feelings of thwarted belongingness."

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: The given post mentions the individual's preference for staying at home and re-watching a favorite movie or TV series instead of going to parties and celebrating the new year.

The post does not mention feeling disconnected, isolated, or lacking social connections.","The given post does not explicitly mention social media usage. However, if we assume that the person is using social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., then there might be an implication of thwarted belongingness due to their preference for spending New Year's Eve alone rather than participating in social gatherings. Social media users often compare their lives with others, and seeing friends and acquaintances celebrating on such occasions may lead to feelings of exclusion and lack of connection. Thus, while the post itself doesn't directly indicate thwarted belongingness, there could be underlying emotions associated with social comparison and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) related to social media use."

The line ""nobody knows who I really am"" implies a lack of intimacy and authenticity in relationships, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Additionally, the reference to pretending to be happy through forced smiles and laughing may indicate a desire for acceptance and approval from others, which further highlights the individual's struggle to feel connected on a deeper level.

However, there are several factors that could suggest an increased risk of perceived burdensomeness: 1. Negative self-evaluations: The author expresses feelings of being tired and overwhelmed by various challenges in their life (e.g., bullying at school, difficulty running due to asthma). These negative evaluations may contribute to a sense of personal burden. 2. Lack of support from others: The author mentions encountering obstacles when trying to stand up for themselves against perceived adversaries. If they feel unsupported by authority figures such as teachers or coaches, they might be less likely to seek help when needed. 3. Emotional distress: The post describes past struggles and acknowledges facing difficulties currently. It also suggests that the individual has experienced disappointment and setbacks, which can further increase perceptions of burdensomeness. 4. Focus on external validation: The author emphasizes that their worth should not be defined solely by grades, social circles, or other external factors. While it is important to maintain autonomy and self-determination, placing excessive importance on these aspects can lead to heightened sensitivity to criticism and rejection. While the post alone cannot definitively diagnose someone with perceived burdensomeness, it raises concerns given the presence of multiple risk factors. Further evaluation would be necessary to determine if the person is experiencing symptoms related to perceived burdensomeness or any other mental health issues."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions feeling detached from things that typically bring happiness to people, which suggests a disconnection from sources of belongingness.

"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions pointing a squirt gun that looks like a real gun at a cop and mentions intentions of suicide. The act of pointing a gun-like object at a police officer can be seen as a threat and can escalate the situation, potentially putting both the individual and the officer in danger. 2.

Additionally, they seem resigned to the idea that their mental health may not improve, indicating a deep sense of hopelessness about their ability to belong."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions having no self-esteem for years, which is a risk factor for perceived burdensomeness. It shows a negative self-perception and a sense of worthlessness.
2. The post also mentions developing major and chronic depression, which further increases the risk of perceived burdensomeness. Depression often leads to feelings of hopelessness and a belief that others would be better off without the person.
3. The post mentions that rebuilding self-esteem takes decades of kindness, acceptance, and love, and expresses doubt that this is possible. This suggests a belief that the person may never overcome their perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post ends with a statement about the person's life sucking, which indicates a negative overall outlook and potentially reinforces the perception of being a burden on others.
Overall, these factors suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness in this post.","Yes, the post shows a perception of being burdened by one's own struggles with low self-esteem, which has led to chronic depression. The person acknowledges knowing what they need to do to improve their situation, but feels unable to take action due to the lengthy process required to rebuild self-esteem. They also express weariness after attempting to overcome their issues for four years, further highlighting their sense of burden."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual discusses their history of self-medicating with alcohol and their recent decision to take their depression and anxiety seriously.

The individual does mention joining the stopdrinking Reddit and expressing a desire for support, which suggests a recognition of the importance of seeking help and potentially connecting with others who are going through similar experiences. However, without more information about their social relationships and feelings of connection, it is difficult to determine if there is a risk of thwarted belongingness based solely on this post.","The post does not explicitly mention thwarted belongingness as a motivator for change, although it suggests some dissatisfaction with one's social environment. Rather than being driven by a desire to belong, the individual appears more focused on managing their own internal struggles related to substance abuse and mental health issues. However, it cannot be ruled out entirely that feelings of isolation or disconnection may have contributed to their decision to seek help and make changes in their life."

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual expresses frustration and cynicism towards the idea of celebrating and drinking to try and improve their problems. While this may indicate dissatisfaction or pessimism, there is no mention of lacking connectedness or inadequate belongingness. The post focuses more on the individual's negative outlook and skepticism towards finding solutions in celebratory activities, rather than interpersonal risk factors related to mental disturbance.","The post appears to suggest a negative attitude towards celebrating holidays or special occasions as a means of coping with one's problems. The author seems to argue that simply getting drunk or partying won't solve one's underlying issues such as financial struggles, lack of social connections, etc. This perspective could be seen as an example of thwarted belongingness, where individuals feel left out or excluded from traditional sources of support and connection due to their personal circumstances (e.g., poverty, illness, disability). In response, they may adopt alternative strategies for coping with these feelings, which in this case is criticizing others who engage in what they perceive as superficial forms of celebration."

3. While the individual expresses a need for help and guidance, it does not necessarily point to a sense of inadequacy in their connectedness. They are seeking advice on how to overcome their current difficulties, but it is not explicitly stated that they feel disconnected from others.","The post does not explicitly mention thwarted belongingness as a specific concern, but rather focuses on the individual's struggles with their own personal growth and self-discipline. However, it can be inferred that the person may be experiencing feelings of isolation or disconnection due to their difficulties in achieving certain goals related to improving their wellbeing. It could also suggest they are struggling to find support or understanding among others who might provide them with encouragement and motivation. Therefore, there is an implied aspect of thwarted belongingness present within the context of the post."

This could be seen as an expression of feelings of hopelessness or despair related to a perceived lack of social support or sense of belonging. The question itself implies a desire for relief from suffering or emotional distress, which may indicate a need for intervention by mental health professionals or loved ones to address underlying issues related to feeling disconnected from others. However, without more context about the individual's specific situation and history, it is difficult to say definitively whether the post indicates a risk of thwarted belongingness."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions a specific method of self-harm (downing a bottle of sleeping pills and painkillers), which suggests a level of intent to harm oneself. This is a clear indication of perceived burdensomeness as the individual is considering ending their own life.
2. The question itself implies a desire for an escape from their current state of distress or perceived burdensomeness. A person who feels burdened and sees no way out may resort to such extreme measures.
3. The combination of sleeping pills and painkillers indicates a deliberate and potentially lethal act, further emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and the high risk of perceived burdensomeness.","The post does not explicitly mention or demonstrate suicidal ideation. However, it raises concerns about the person's mental health and well-being since they are contemplating taking potentially harmful substances to end their life.

It would be important for someone who knows them well to have an open conversation with them about their thoughts and feelings during these times."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions multiple stressful situations within their personal life, including a terminally ill mother, a sick sister, and a partner with mental health issues. These stressors can potentially create a sense of overwhelm and emotional strain, impacting connectedness.
2. They express feeling like no one is there for them, suggesting a lack of social support and connectedness with others.
3. The individual states that they are trying hard to be there for everyone else, implying a sense of caretaking and potentially neglecting their own needs.

The mention of their mother having terminal cancer, their sister being unwell during her pregnancy, and their partner struggling with mental health issues all suggest that they are facing significant difficulties within their close social circle. Additionally, the reference to not receiving support or understanding from friends and acquaintances may further exacerbate these feelings of loneliness and lack of connection. While the post does not explicitly state whether the individual experiences chronic loneliness or social anxiety, the overall context suggests that they may be at risk of developing such symptoms due to the numerous adversities they face."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1.

3. The mention of the group partying together without them, including on New Year's Eve, further reinforces feelings of being left out and potentially experiencing thwarted belongingness.","The post suggests a sense of exclusion and rejection by one's peers or social group. The author mentions feeling left out when their friends go on vacation together without inviting them, despite having previously believed they had a connection with these individuals. This lack of inclusion could be seen as an example of thwarted belongingness, which refers to feelings of not being accepted or included within a particular social context (Harris & Floyd, 2015). In the given scenario, it appears that the individual is experiencing such feelings due to perceived rejection from their peer group."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling alone and being excluded from social activities. These feelings of social isolation can contribute to perceived burdensomeness, as individuals may interpret exclusion as a sign that they are not valued or liked by others.

This difficulty in achieving educational goals may contribute to their overall feelings of not belonging and also potentially hinder their ability to access future opportunities for connectedness.
4. The individual mentions the possibility of becoming homeless if their parents die, which indicates a lack of a stable and supportive living environment. This further demonstrates a potential disruption of connectedness and feelings of insecurity and isolation.","The post does not explicitly mention the concept of thwarted belongingness.

They express their desire for some kind of support or connection on their birthday, which seems to be an important day for them. 3. Despite receiving positive responses from others in the past, they still feel lonely and isolated. 4.

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual is expressing frustration and confusion about their inability to cry when they feel sad. While the post does convey a sense of emotional distress, it does not specifically mention any feelings of inadequacy in terms of connectedness or belongingness. Therefore, it does not suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness.","The post seems to express feelings of frustration, anger, and confusion related to the inability to experience emotions such as sadness or crying. While these emotions are typically associated with social support and connection (belonging), they may also be experienced alone or independently from others. The post itself doesn't explicitly mention any desire for social interaction or belongingness, but rather focuses on the individual's struggle with their own emotional experiences. Therefore, while there might be an underlying sense of disconnection or lack of fitting in due to the inability to cry, the main theme of the post appears to be the personal struggle with emotional regulation rather than a specific need for social connection."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions experiencing sadness and a desire to cry but being unable to do so. This suggests a possible emotional distress and difficulty in expressing emotions, which can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also mentions engaging in physical behaviors, such as clenching fists and grinding teeth, in an attempt to make oneself cry. This suggests a possible form of self-harm or self-destructive behavior, which can further amplify feelings of burdensomeness.
3. The tone of frustration and confusion in the post indicates a struggle with understanding and coping with these emotions.

Overall, the post demonstrates several interpersonal risk factors of mental disturbance, suggesting a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.","The post seems to indicate that the author has experienced an inability to cry, which may be related to feelings of sadness or emotional distress. The act of trying to force oneself to cry through physical actions such as doubling over, clenching one's fists, and grinding one's teeth could potentially lead to increased frustration and anxiety if it fails to produce the desired result. Additionally, the fact that the author has engaged in this behavior for six years without stopping to question its nature suggests that they may lack awareness about the potential risks associated with their behavior. However, more information is needed to fully assess whether there is a risk of perceived burdensomeness present in this situation."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual mentions feeling sorry for themselves and expresses a desire to die. This suggests a serious mental health issue, such as depression or suicidal ideation.

The fact that they have sought help through multiple therapists suggests that they are attempting to address these issues and improve their sense of belongingness. However, if the person feels like they cannot continue on in life, then there is an increased risk of suicide which could lead to a lack of belonging after death."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling bad for the way the person is, indicating a negative self-perception and possibly low self-worth, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also mentions trying various interventions such as therapy, medications, exercise, and diet changes, suggesting that the person has been actively seeking help for their mental health struggles.
3. However, despite these efforts, the person expresses a desire to not be alive anymore and states that something inside them wants them dead. This indicates a significant level of distress and suggests that they may be experiencing thoughts of burden and feeling like they would be better off gone.","The post does not explicitly mention suicidal ideation or intentions, but it does convey feelings of extreme distress and hopelessness. The person is apologizing for their struggles and acknowledging that they have attempted to improve themselves through various means (therapy, medication, exercise, and diet).

3. The post expresses a desire for self-love and the need for connection and intimacy.

These include being recently laid off (which can lead to financial stress), growing up in a family with mental illness and abuse (which may have led to feelings of isolation and loneliness), struggling with addiction and depression (both of which can contribute to negative self-perception and feelings of worthlessness), and having difficulty forming connections with others due to past experiences. Additionally, the post suggests a desire for physical touch and connection, yet also expresses fear and reluctance towards such interactions.

3. The individual expresses anxiety about their upcoming psychological evaluation, indicating a level of distress and potential difficulty in finding adequate mental health support.
Overall, these factors suggest a sense of inadequacy in connectedness and a need for stronger social support.","The post does not explicitly mention thwarted belongingness as a specific concept or theory. However, there are some elements in the post that could be indicative of feelings related to social connection and acceptance. The author mentions trying different methods to feel happier, including faking it until they make it, which suggests a desire to fit in or belong. Additionally, their mentioning feeling like their mother doesn't understand their struggles with depression may indicate a sense of disconnection from supportive relationships. Furthermore, the author's concern over being seen as selfish during therapy sessions might suggest a fear of rejection or abandonment by others if they were to open up too much.

The post also mentions seeking help and feeling unsupported by the response received, with others making it about themselves and criticizing the poster for being selfish. This can further contribute to perceived burdensomeness and feelings of isolation. 3. The post expresses a desire to get better and feel genuinely happy, indicating a dissatisfaction with current mental state and a possible desire to escape from the perceived burdensomeness.","The post does not explicitly mention feelings of being a burden to others or feeling like one's problems are too much to handle, which is why it doesn't directly address the first two questions in your list related to those specific concepts. However, there are some indications throughout the text that suggest the person might be experiencing these thoughts. Here are some examples:  1. The use of phrases such as ""it hurts to keep going"" (para 2) and ""i don't know what to do anymore"" (para 3), could imply that the individual feels overwhelmed by their emotions and struggles. This can sometimes lead to perceiving oneself as a burden on others if one believes that sharing their issues would impose unnecessary difficulties on others. 2. In para 4, the author mentions feeling hesitant to reach out for help because previous attempts led to others making it about themselves instead. This may indicate that the writer perceives her own needs as less important than those of others, potentially leading to feelings of guilt or belief that seeking support is self-centered. 3. Lastly, the expression of fear and anxiety regarding the upcoming psychological evaluation (para 7) suggests that the individual might be apprehensive about discussing their problems with someone else. It's possible that this apprehension stems from concerns about appearing burdensome or being seen as having insignificant issues."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In the given post, the individual expresses feelings of distress and frustration, but there is no specific mention of a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. While the individual discusses feeling unable to control their body's responses and implies a negative view of humanity, these factors alone do not necessarily indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness.

However, there are certain language patterns and themes within the post that could potentially indicate an increased risk of perceived burdensomeness. These include:  1. Feelings of confusion and insecurity related to the behavior of the person they have feelings for. This can be particularly concerning as these emotions often precede more serious issues such as depression or anxiety. 2.

This can lead to frustration and disappointment, which may contribute to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness over time. 3. Difficulties in communication and connection with others, including both positive connections (such as wanting to dance privately) and negative ones (like flirting with other men). This lack of clarity around their own desires and needs might create uncertainty and low self-esteem. 4. Ambivalence towards the relationship, suggesting that the writer may struggle to determine whether they should continue pursuing it further due to conflicting signals coming from their partner. Uncertainty in relationships can be emotionally draining and increase feelings of worthlessness. 5. The presence of jealousy and insecurity regarding how their partner interacts with other people while under the influence of alcohol. Jealousy can stem from deep insecurities and fears, and if unaddressed, it can escalate into deeper psychological distress. 6.

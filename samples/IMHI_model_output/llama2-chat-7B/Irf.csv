The post does show a risk of perceived burdensomeness. Here are some reasons why:

1. Use of the word ""greedy"": The author uses the word ""greedy"" to describe their feelings, which can be seen as a negative connotation. This implies that they feel like they are taking up too much space or resources, and that they are not content with what they have.

3. Lack of self-compassion: The author seems to be critical of themselves for wanting more, rather than acknowledging that it is normal to have desires and aspirations. This lack of self-compassion can contribute to feelings of burdensomeness.
4. Internal comparison: The author compares themselves to others (e.g. ""I know I am good in my job, and also that I am a good, nice, kind person who cares about others""), which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and burdensomeness.

* The use of the word ""greedy"" (e.g. ""I have been struggling with the idea of being too greedy"")
* The focus on what the author doesn't have (e.g. ""So, what do I have to complain about? Why am I not satisfied?"")

The post ""down for a chat"" shows risk of thwarted belongingness in the following ways: 1.

Lack of control: The person has little control over the outcome of the post, as they are at the mercy of the target audience's response (or lack thereof). This can lead to feelings of powerlessness and disconnection from others. 4. Emotional investment: The person has invested emotions in the post, hoping for a response, which can lead to feelings of disappointment, frustration, and low self-esteem if the post goes unanswered. 5. False expectations: The post may create false expectations of social interaction, leading to disappointment and disillusionment if the target audience does not respond.

Answer: Yes, the post ""down for a chat"" can be perceived as showing risk of perceived burdensomeness. Here's why:

1. Over-commitment: By saying ""down for a chat,"" the person is essentially committing to spend time with the other person, which can be perceived as over-committing. This can lead to feelings of burdensomeness, especially if the other person is not able to follow through on their end of the commitment.
2. Unclear expectations: The phrase ""down for a chat"" can be vague and open-ended, leaving the other person unclear about what the conversation will entail. This lack of clarity can lead to feelings of burdensomeness, as the person may feel like they are being asked to invest time and energy without a clear understanding of what they will get in return.
3. Lack of control: When someone says ""down for a chat,"" they are essentially putting themselves at the mercy of the other person. They have little control over the direction or duration of the conversation, which can lead to feelings of burdensomeness.
4. Potential for conflict: Depending on the context, a conversation can quickly turn into a conflict, especially if the other person has different expectations or opinions. This can lead to feelings of burdensomeness, as the person may feel like they are being asked to navigate a difficult or uncomfortable situation.

Overall, while the phrase ""down for a chat"" may seem innocuous, it can actually show risk of perceived burdensomeness due to the potential for over-commitment, unclear expectations, lack of control, and potential for conflict."

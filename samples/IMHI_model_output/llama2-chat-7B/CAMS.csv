"This post shows causes of depression related to alienation. Reasoning: The post discusses the disconnect between how the poster feels mentally and how their body physically presents. They describe feeling fine mentally, but their face and body manifest depression and sadness, making it impossible for them to convey their true emotions to the world. This sense of alienation and disconnect between their internal state and external appearance is likely causing mental disorders for the poster, as they are unable to authentically express themselves and feel understood by others.","

Answer: This post shows a classic symptom of somatic depression, which is characterized by physical symptoms of depression that do not match the individual's mental state. The author experiences a lack of emotional expression in their face and body, despite feeling mentally fine. This can make it difficult for others to understand the individual's emotional state, leading them to assume that the person is depressed about something specific when in reality, they are simply struggling with somatic depression.

Somatic depression is a common symptom of depression that can be caused by a variety of factors, including:

1. Genetics: Some people may be more prone to somatic depression due to their genetic makeup.
2. Brain chemistry: Imbalances in neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine can contribute to somatic depression.
3. Chronic stress: Prolonged stress can lead to somatic depression, as the body's stress response system becomes overactive.
4. Trauma: People who have experienced trauma may be more likely to experience somatic depression.
5. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as chronic pain or sleep disorders, can contribute to somatic depression.

In this post, the author experiences somatic depression as a result of chronic stress and a lack of self-care. They feel mentally fine, but their body is unable to express this emotional state, leading to a physical appearance that does not match their mental state. This can be a challenging experience, as the author notes that it is almost impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of themselves, even though they should otherwise be mentally fine."

Answer: This post shows a clear indication of a suicidal ideation, which is a symptom of depression.

1. Disconnection from body: The author of the post mentions having anorexia, which is a disorder that can lead to a disconnection from one's body and its needs. This disconnection can also manifest as a lack of self-care and self-compassion, which are essential for spiritual wellness.
2. Internalized shame and self-criticism: The author's mother's criticism and the comments from strangers on social media contribute to the author's internalized shame and self-criticism. This can create a cycle of self-blame and self-doubt that can be challenging to break.

Intellectual wellness is a relatively new concept that has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the context of mental health and wellness. It refers to the ability to think, reason, and solve problems effectively, as well as to engage in critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. In other words, intellectual wellness is about how well we are able to use our minds to navigate the world around us.

Now, let's analyze the post you provided and see if it reflects any aspects of intellectual wellness:

1. Critical thinking: The post does not demonstrate any critical thinking skills. The author seems to accept their poor performance at work and lack of skills without questioning or analyzing the reasons behind it. There is no attempt to identify the root causes of their problems or to come up with solutions. Therefore, this dimension is not present in the post.
2. Creativity: The post does not show any signs of creativity. The author's solution to their problems is to drink more alcohol, which is not a creative or innovative solution. In fact, it is likely to exacerbate their problems rather than solve them. Therefore, this dimension is also absent from the post.
3. Problem-solving: The post does not demonstrate any problem-solving skills. The author does not attempt to identify the problems they are facing or to come up with solutions. Instead, they simply accept their situation and move on to the next activity (drinking). Therefore, this dimension is not present in the post.
4. Reasoning: The post does not show any evidence of reasoning skills. The author does not provide any logical reasoning or explanations for their actions or problems. Instead, they simply express their feelings and emotions without any logical framework. Therefore, this dimension is not present in the post.

Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the intellectual wellness dimension is not present in the post you provided. The author does not demonstrate any critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, or reasoning skills, which are all essential components of intellectual wellness."

This includes their ability to form and maintain relationships, communicate effectively, and navigate social situations with ease and confidence.

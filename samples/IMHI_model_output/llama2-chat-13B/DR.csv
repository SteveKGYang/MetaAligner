The tone of the post seems more pragmatic and seeking information rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress. Additionally, the mention of being a non-native English speaker suggests that any imperfections in the writing could be attributed to language fluency rather than emotional distress.",Please provide a brief explanation of your answer.
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: it is not possible to determine if the poster suffers from depression. This is because the post is not in English and does not provide any emotional or personal information that can be analyzed for signs of depression.","

The title of the post translates to ""Selling products online"" in English, and the content of the post is about the benefits of selling products online and how to get started with it. There is no indication in the post that the poster is experiencing any negative emotions or mental health issues."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a tragic and unlucky history within their mother's side of the family, expressing feelings of shock, fascination, and a sense of being cursed.

The overall tone is one of deep sadness, highlighting the overwhelming impact of the family's misfortunes on the poster's emotional well-being.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression based on the text. While the poster describes a series of tragic events that occurred in their family, they do not express any personal feelings of depression or mention any symptoms of depression. The text is written in a matter-of-fact tone and is focused on the events that occurred in the poster's family. Additionally, the poster states that their grandmother, who experienced the loss of four children and a husband, is still going strong mentally and physically, which suggests that the poster does not have a personal history of depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post mainly expresses frustration and disappointment with a friend changing plans and not prioritizing the poster's time. While there may be some underlying emotions of hurt or feeling unimportant, the post does not exhibit the profound sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or numbness typically associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more focused on the specific incident and its impact on the poster's plans, rather than addressing deeper emotional issues commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not seem to suffer from depression. The poster is simply feeling frustrated and hurt by their friend's boyfriend's actions and the fact that they were not prioritized in their friend's schedule. The poster is also feeling annoyed and inconvenienced by the change in plans and the fact that their only day off this week is being disrupted. These emotions are all normal and understandable given the situation, but they do not necessarily indicate depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not display emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster is seeking advice and experiences from others regarding the decision to have children. While there is a slight sense of uncertainty and questioning about the future, it does not convey a deep sense of hopelessness or emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more introspective and curious rather than despairing or overwhelmed.","

No, the poster does not seem to suffer from depression. The post is simply seeking advice and exploring their own thoughts and feelings about having children. There is no indication of depressive symptoms such as low mood, loss of interest in activities, or changes in appetite or sleep patterns. The poster is expressing a desire for self-discovery and is open to hearing others' experiences, which is a healthy and normal part of personal growth and development."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of failure and lack of accomplishment in various areas of life. The poster expresses a desire to be good at something, anything, that could bring happiness and fulfillment. The mention of having failed at everything they have tried and feeling good at absolutely nothing implies a significant level of self-doubt and low self-esteem. The poster also expresses a desire to find something to keep themselves busy, suggesting a lack of fulfillment and purpose in their life. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, indicating that the poster may be suffering from depression.","

I would say that the person who made this post might be experiencing some symptoms of depression, but it's not necessarily a definitive diagnosis. Here's why:

1. Lack of self-worth: The person expresses feeling ""good at absolutely nothing,"" which suggests a lack of self-worth and self-confidence. This is a common symptom of depression.
2. Feelings of failure: The person mentions having failed at everything they've tried, which could be a source of feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.
3. Search for meaning and purpose: The person expresses a desire to find something they're good at and can devote themselves to, which suggests a desire for meaning and purpose in their life. This is a common theme in depression.
4. Emotional numbness: The person doesn't seem to have any positive emotions or interests, which could be a sign of emotional numbness, a common symptom of depression.

However, it's important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and not everyone will exhibit all of these symptoms. Additionally, it's possible that the person who made this post is simply feeling frustrated or discouraged, rather than clinically depressed. It's important to approach the situation with compassion and understanding, rather than jumping to conclusions or making assumptions."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a feeling of loneliness and a desire to connect with others. The poster expresses a need to talk to someone and get out of their own thoughts, suggesting a sense of isolation and possibly a lack of social support. While the post does not explicitly mention emotional distress, the mention of loneliness and the desire to escape one's own thoughts can be indicative of depressive symptoms.","

No, the poster does not necessarily suffer from depression. The post simply expresses a desire for human connection and a need to talk to someone. The use of the word ""lonely"" and the phrase ""get out of my head"" suggest that the poster may be feeling isolated or overwhelmed, but this does not necessarily indicate a diagnosis of depression. It is important to avoid making assumptions about someone's mental health based on a single post or statement. Instead, it may be more helpful to offer support and a listening ear, and to ask open-ended questions to encourage the poster to share more about their feelings and needs."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post suggests a deep sense of apathy, hopelessness, and a lack of motivation or enjoyment in life. The poster describes engaging in activities such as playing video games, mourning, and listening to sad songs as a way to cope, but even these activities seem to bring little joy or fulfillment. The mention of wanting weed as a means of escape suggests a desire to numb or escape from emotional pain. The question about the point of living anymore highlights a significant level of despair and questioning of the meaning or purpose of life. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

  Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The post expresses a sense of hopelessness, a lack of interest in activities, and a desire to escape from reality through video games and drugs, which are all common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions ""mourning for death"" and feeling like life is ""a boring shit show,"" which suggest a sense of despair and a lack of meaning or purpose in life. The poster's statement that they ""just accept"" their thoughts and feelings also suggests a lack of motivation and a sense of resignation, which are both common symptoms of depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates some frustration and dissatisfaction with a friend, but it does not convey significant emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster primarily discusses their decision to end a friendship due to conflicts and communication issues. Although there may be some emotional impact from the situation, the overall tone of the post seems more assertive and self-protective, rather than indicating severe depression.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly indicates that the poster's girlfriend is experiencing depression. The poster describes their girlfriend slipping ""into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression"" and mentions her feeling lost and depressed. The girlfriend's behavior, such as smoking weed excessively, sleeping excessively, and having a never satisfied state, aligns with common symptoms of depression. The mention of trying to distract her and encourage her with various activities and goals, but seeing no improvement, suggests the persistence and severity of her depression. The sudden breakup and the girlfriend's request for space further indicate the presence of emotional distress and potential depressive symptoms. Overall, the post reflects the poster's deep concern for their girlfriend's well-being and their struggle to understand and support her during this difficult time.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post discusses the potential side effects of SSRIs and how they can mimic symptoms of hypomania. The poster goes into detail about experiencing trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, increased spending, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, and increased engagement in old hobbies. These symptoms align with the characteristics of a hypomanic episode, which is a key symptom of bipolar disorder. The poster acknowledges that they require professional advice but also seeks to hear about others' experiences, suggesting a personal concern or potential experience with this issue. The focus on the emotional and behavioral effects of medication aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression and bipolar disorder. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that the poster may be dealing with depression or bipolar disorder.",

The poster describes feeling hurt and depressed after their best friend started prioritizing his girlfriend over their friendship. They express a longing for things to go back to how they were before the girlfriend, highlighting the significance of the friendship and the hurt they feel from being pushed aside.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of interest, enjoyment, and pleasure in activities other than listening to music. The poster describes everything else as boring, draining, and dull, indicating a lack of motivation or fulfillment in their daily life. This aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in activities) and lack of motivation. The emphasis on wanting to listen to music all day and ""space out"" suggests a desire to escape or disconnect from their current emotional state. Overall, the post conveys a sense of emotional distress and lack of fulfillment that is consistent with depression.","

Answer: Based on the information provided, it is possible that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression. The desire to spend all day listening to music and the lack of interest in other activities, as well as the description of everything else as ""boring, draining, and dull,"" could be indicative of depressive symptoms. However, it is important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it is not possible to make a definitive diagnosis based solely on this one post. It is also possible that the poster may be experiencing other emotional or psychological issues, or that they may be going through a temporary period of low motivation or boredom."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post contains several indicators of the emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The poster describes feeling a sense of nothingness, dread, and a severe low point. They express difficulty in finding words to describe their feelings and experiencing an out-of-body sensation. The mention of feeling like their body is giving up and the correlation between exercise and a decrease in feelings of loneliness and sickness suggests a lack of motivation and a potential loss of interest in activities. The poster also mentions finding solace in interaction with others, indicating a potential need for social support and a sense of belonging. The overall tone of the post is despairing, with the poster expressing a desire for improvement in their own life and the lives of those around them. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, exhaustion, and numbness. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed by even simple tasks and expresses a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment from activities that are typically pleasurable. The mention of trying various methods including exercise, diet, meditation, and medication without success indicates a prolonged struggle with their emotional state. The overall tone of hopelessness, lack of positive experiences, and the feeling that every day is a struggle suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The symptoms described in the post are more indicative of burnout, which is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress. The poster mentions feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and numb, but does not mention feelings of hopelessness or helplessness, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster has tried various strategies such as exercise, diet, meditation, and meds, which is consistent with burnout rather than depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses frustration and anger towards people who joke or make light of depression, highlighting the stark contrast between their own personal experiences of daily struggle and the casual treatment of depressive thoughts and coping mechanisms as fun or funny. The mention of feeling like they are falling off the wagon and going completely bonkers suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a potential lack of coping mechanisms. The poster also acknowledges that even within the depressed community, experiences vary, indicating an awareness of the complexity of depression. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of pain, isolation, and frustration that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The poster is expressing frustration and anger towards people who make light of depression and suicidal thoughts by sharing memes or joking about it, while the poster themselves is struggling with real experiences of depression and suicidal thoughts. The poster is upset that people who are not clinically depressed are using language and behaviors associated with depression as a way to seek attention or be funny, which the poster feels minimizes the seriousness of the issue and can be hurtful to those who are genuinely struggling."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a desire for a different solution to the problem of drugs being temporary. This suggests a dissatisfaction with current methods of relief and a longing for a more effective or long-lasting solution. This sentiment aligns with the experience of many individuals suffering from depression, who may feel frustrated by the temporary relief provided by medication and wish for a more permanent solution. The post does not provide extensive detail about the individual's emotions or experiences, but the mention of drugs as a temporary solution implies a deeper underlying struggle that may be indicative of depression.","

I don't think the poster necessarily suffers from depression. The statement ""I wish drugs weren't a temporary solution"" could be interpreted in a few different ways, and it's not necessarily a sign of depression. Here are a few possible interpretations:

1. The poster may be referring to the fact that drugs are often used to treat symptoms of depression, but they may not address the underlying causes of the condition. In this case, the poster may be wishing for a more permanent solution to their depression, rather than just treating the symptoms with drugs.
2. The poster may be referring to the fact that drugs can have temporary side effects or withdrawal symptoms, and they may be wishing for a solution that doesn't have these negative effects.
3. The poster may be referring to the fact that drugs can be addictive, and they may be wishing for a solution that doesn't involve the risk of addiction.

Overall, it's difficult to say for sure what the poster is referring to without more context or information. It's possible that the poster does suffer from depression, but it's also possible that they are referring to a different issue or concern."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses some emotional struggles and vulnerability, such as giving too much in relationships and getting hurt, there is not a pervasive sense of hopelessness or despair.

Overall, the tone of the post does not strongly align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.","

No, the poster does not seem to suffer from depression. They mention being emotional and getting hurt easily, but these are common experiences for many people, and do not necessarily indicate depression.

This is not typically a symptom of depression."

The poster describes feeling insignificant and unimportant, believing that others prioritize their needs above their own. They express feeling like they are being used and taken advantage of by others, comparing themselves to a stepping stone in a swamp. The statement about not deserving to feel good and the belief that nobody would care if they were to kill themselves further illustrate their deep emotional distress and potential suicidal thoughts. These expressions align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, indicating a significant level of emotional distress.","

Answer: Yes, the poster seems to suffer from depression. The language used in the post suggests feelings of low self-worth, hopelessness, and a lack of purpose.

The mention of needing to find something that works specifically for the reader suggests a potential struggle with managing emotions or finding solace in other activities. The post does not explicitly mention feelings of sadness or hopelessness, but the desire for comfort and the positive impact that the show has on their well-being may indicate underlying depressive symptoms.","

  I would say no. The poster does not mention any symptoms of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed. Instead, they mention that the show helps them sleep and feel better, which suggests that they may be experiencing stress or anxiety.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a strong sense of hopelessness, despair, and self-esteem issues. The poster expresses feelings of not knowing their purpose for living and lacking love and support from friends and family. They also mention feeling ugly, awkward, and overall worthless. The lack of future plans, isolating behavior, and reliance on escapist activities suggest a disconnection from reality and an overall negative outlook on life.

Answer: Yes, the poster's statement suggests that they may suffer from depression. The poster expresses feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and a lack of purpose in life, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions that they have no one to love them, which can also be a contributing factor to depression.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of hopelessness and desperation, with the mention of feeling suicidal due to the belief that they will never be able to afford to leave their parents' house. This level of despair and thoughts of self-harm are indicative of severe depression. The post also alludes to a lack of financial stability and a feeling of being trapped, which can contribute to feelings of depression.

This is a very difficult question to answer, as depression can manifest in many different ways and can be difficult to diagnose. However, based on the information provided in the post, it is possible that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression.

Here are some reasons why:

1. Feelings of hopelessness: The poster states that the idea of living with their parents forever because they can't make much more than minimum wage makes them feel suicidal. This can be a common symptom of depression, as individuals may feel overwhelmed and hopeless about their situation.
2. Lack of motivation: The poster mentions that they are ""stuck"" living with their parents, which can be a sign of a lack of motivation or energy. This can also be a symptom of depression.

4. Lack of social support: The poster does not mention any social support or connections that might help them cope with their situation. Social isolation and a lack of support can contribute to depression.

It's important to note that this is just a possible interpretation based on the information provided, and it's not possible to diagnose depression without a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress, particularly regarding the poster's mental health struggles and their friend's response to their suicidal thoughts. The mention of severe anxiety, prior experiences of bullying, and family issues leading to depression indicates a history of psychological distress. The poster expresses feeling hurt and confused by their friend's response, which suggests a lack of social support or understanding. This combination of emotional pain, distressing life events, and the potential loss of a social connection aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","If so, what kind of depression does the poster have?"
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post primarily discusses a classmate who exhibits bullying behavior and the annoyance and frustration it causes. While there may be some negative emotions associated with the situation, such as annoyance and confusion, the post does not express a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair that is typically indicative of depression. The tone of the post is more focused on seeking advice and solutions for the bullying issue rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress.","I think the answer is no, and here's why: 1. The poster is able to recognize that the classmate's behavior is not normal and is causing problems. This suggests that the poster is not so consumed by their own issues that they are unable to see the behavior of others. 2. The poster is able to articulate the classmate's behavior clearly and is seeking help. This also suggests that the poster is not depressed. Depression can cause difficulty with communication and motivation, among other things. 3. The poster is able to list specific examples of the classmate's behavior and is seeking advice on how to handle the situation. This suggests that the poster is not overwhelmed by their own emotions and is able to think critically about the situation. 4. The poster is aware that the classmate's behavior is not only affecting the class, but also the teachers and other people. This suggests that the poster is able to see the bigger picture and is not only focused on their own problems. Based on these points, it seems unlikely that the poster suffers from depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotions and experiences commonly associated with depression. The poster describes feelings of social awkwardness and anxiety, as well as expressing regret and self-blame for their past actions. They also mention experiencing panic attacks and anxiety when considering confronting the person they had an awkward past with. These emotional experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as low self-esteem, social withdrawal, and feelings of guilt or worthlessness. Overall, the tone of the post conveys a significant level of emotional distress that suggests a connection to depression.","Answer: No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The poster is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks, which are common symptoms of social anxiety disorder. The poster's desire to apologize and make amends for their past behavior suggests that they are experiencing remorse and a desire to improve their relationship with this person, which is a common trait in individuals with social anxiety disorder. Additionally, the poster's self-awareness of their past behavior and their desire to change it is also a common trait in individuals with social anxiety disorder."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post presents several indicators of depression. The poster describes a profound sense of emotional numbness and an inability to feel or enjoy anything. They express a lack of fulfillment in their usual activities and a constant state of dullness.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post clearly outlines a constant battle between ambition and a desire to not live, accompanied by recurring suicidal thoughts. The poster does not express low self-esteem but rather a slight superiority complex. They mention a lack of happiness and the feeling of living as a continuous chore. The struggle between wanting to be successful and wanting to stop existing is described as a never-ending conflict, with the fear that attaining success would lead to the failure of wanting to stop existing. The poster acknowledges that their university workload has exacerbated their difficulties in functioning. They mention considering getting help but feeling uncomfortable with the idea of opening up to someone due to not being a very emotional person. The acceptance that they will probably never be happy and wondering if attaining their desired level of success would increase the likelihood of them committing suicide indicate a significant level of emotional distress and align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of hopelessness, anxiety, and the belief that they can never be content suggests a profound emotional struggle typically seen in severe cases of depression.","

Answer: Based on the information provided, it is possible that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression, particularly persistent low mood and a loss of interest in activities they once found enjoyable. However, it is important to note that depression can manifest differently in different individuals, and it is not always possible to diagnose based on a single post.

The poster mentions having recurring suicidal thoughts since they were 12 years old, which is a common symptom of depression. They also mention feeling a sense of hopelessness and a lack of contentment, despite their ambition and achievements. Additionally, the poster's statement that they ""will probably never be happy"" and their consideration of suicide as a potential solution to their struggles suggest that they may be experiencing depressive symptoms.

However, it is important to note that the poster also mentions having a superiority complex and a desire for success, which could potentially be a sign of a different mental health issue, such as narcissistic personality disorder. It is also possible that the poster's struggles are primarily related to their academic workload and the pressure they feel to succeed, rather than a mental health condition.

Without more information, it is difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis or recommendation for treatment. If the poster is experiencing persistent struggles with low mood, loss of interest in activities, and suicidal thoughts, it may be helpful for them to seek out professional help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. A mental health professional can provide a more thorough assessment and recommend appropriate treatment."

This connection between mood and physical sensations is common in individuals with depression. Additionally, the reference to having experienced similar sensations in the past when super depressed indicates a history of depressive episodes. Overall, the post conveys a sense of emotional distress and physical symptoms that align with depression.","

No, the poster does not necessarily suffer from depression. The statement ""I used to get my whole body feeling like that when i was super depressed"" suggests that the poster has experienced depression in the past, but the current symptoms of droopy face and heavy eyelids are not necessarily indicative of depression. It is possible that the poster is experiencing a different emotional state or physical condition that is causing these symptoms."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not display strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. Although there is a mention of feeling conflicted about being a nice friend and not always wanting to be, it does not convey profound emotional pain or hopelessness.

Overall, the post does not suggest a significant level of emotional distress commonly associated with depression.",Why or why not?
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment from both the good and bad times in life.

The overall tone of the post is pessimistic and suggests a feeling of hopelessness or lack of satisfaction with life.","

Answer: Based on the content of the post, it is possible that the poster may suffer from depression. The poster mentions that even the good times are tainted and that they can barely ever enjoy them, which is a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the poster's negative outlook on life and their belief that the good times are not worth living through the bad times may also be indicative of depression. However, it is important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it is not possible to definitively diagnose depression based on a single post. It is important to approach the topic with sensitivity and respect for the individual's privacy and experiences."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of conflict and tension between the poster and their mother, as well as feelings of being misunderstood and belittled. The poster expresses frustration and confusion about the situation and seeks advice on how to deal with it. While there is a mention of feeling ""worthless"" due to the things their mother said, it is not the dominant emotion expressed in the post. Overall, the emotional content of the post does not align with the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression.","I know that it is not my place to diagnose, but based on the post, it seems like they may be struggling with depression. I would like to offer some resources for them to reach out to if they are struggling with their mental health. Would it be appropriate to do so?

I would advise against offering resources for depression without a clear indication from the poster that they are struggling with their mental health. While the post does mention feelings of worthlessness and a desire to move out, it is not necessarily indicative of depression. It's important to respect the poster's privacy and not make assumptions about their mental health without their explicit statement or confirmation.

Instead, you could offer support and understanding, acknowledging the challenges they are facing with their mother and the potential for feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to navigate the situation. You could also suggest seeking support from a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional if they feel it would be helpful. This approach would prioritize the poster's autonomy and agency in seeking support, rather than assuming they need resources without their explicit consent."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and disappointment in the poster's ability to engage in artistic activities, such as drawing, and mentions difficulty in playing video games and typing.

The mention of forcing oneself to draw and perceiving their work as ""garbage"" suggests low self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy. The overall tone of irritation, hopelessness, and struggling to perform simple tasks aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

I would say that the poster does not necessarily suffer from depression based on the content of the post. While they mention feeling frustrated and having difficulty with certain tasks, there are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed. Additionally, the poster mentions that they have forced themselves to draw and found it to be ""garbage,"" which suggests that they may be experiencing some self-criticism or perfectionism, but this is not necessarily a symptom of depression. It's possible that the poster may be experiencing some other mental health issue or a physical condition that is affecting their ability to perform certain tasks, but without more information, it's difficult to say for sure."

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits a significant level of emotional distress and feelings of exhaustion, hopelessness, and a lack of purpose or fulfillment in life. The poster expresses a desire for their spirit to settle and find internal calmness, indicating a deep sense of unease and turmoil.

The overall tone of the post portrays a longing for relief and a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment in life, indicating a potential struggle with depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The poster is seeking a sense of internal calmness and a settling of their spirit, which is not necessarily a symptom of depression. While the poster mentions regrets and a desire to avoid counting or trying to ""get to the next level"" of life, this does not necessarily indicate a depressive state. The poster's focus on finding internal peace and calmness suggests that they may be seeking a more introspective and self-aware existence, rather than a life of external achievement. Additionally, the poster's use of the phrase ""the human game"" suggests that they may be reflecting on the nature of human existence and the challenges that come with it, rather than being driven by a sense of sadness or hopelessness."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys strong emotions of frustration, resentment, and envy towards the poster's brother and parents. The poster describes feeling unheard and invalidated by their parents, who prioritize their brother's needs over their own. There is a sense of isolation and a desire to be noticed and acknowledged by their family. The mention of feeling envious of their brother and questioning whether they should be ""stupid"" in order to gain attention suggests feelings of low self-worth and a lack of support from their immediate family. These emotions and experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

  Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. Here's why:

1. Feelings of isolation: The poster mentions that they feel like they are ""the only one who sees the truth"" about their brother, indicating that they feel isolated from their family and society.
2. Inability to express emotions: The poster states that they have been ""told to be patient"" with their brother, suggesting that they have been suppressing their true feelings for a long time. This can be a common symptom of depression.
3. Low self-esteem: The poster envies their brother's ""easy life"" and feels that they are not good enough to be noticed by their parents. This suggests that they struggle with feelings of low self-worth.
4. Lack of support: The poster mentions that their parents never listen to them when they try to point out their brother's flaws, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and low self-esteem.
5. Negative thoughts: The poster's internal dialogue is negative and critical, with thoughts such as ""he's selfish"" and ""he's not a fool, he's slippery."" This can be a sign of depression.

Overall, the poster's feelings of isolation, inability to express emotions, low self-esteem, lack of support, and negative thoughts suggest that they may be struggling with depression. It is important for them to seek support from a mental health professional to address these issues."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates a deep sense of emotional pain and struggle with depression. The poster expresses feelings of discontent, anxiety, anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure), insecurity, and self-hatred - all symptoms commonly associated with depression.

However, the post also demonstrates some level of hope and resilience, as the poster expresses a desire to turn their negative energy into helping others and making a difference. It is important to note that while the post exhibits signs of depression, it does not necessarily indicate the severity of the condition.","

  Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The post mentions ""discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self-hatred,"" and ""meaninglessness"" which are all common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions that they have a ""good job"" and financial security, yet still experience depression, which is a common experience for many people with depression. The post also mentions that the only times they feel ""alive"" or happy are when they are either on drugs or helping others, which suggests that they may be using substances or activities as a form of coping mechanism for their depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates a lack of understanding or familiarity with the concept of friendship. The question itself suggests a sense of confusion or disconnection from others. While this may not necessarily indicate depression on its own, it could potentially be a sign of social isolation or difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, which can be associated with depression. However, without further emotional indicators or context, it is difficult to definitively determine if the poster suffers from depression based on this post alone.","

The poster asks ""what's a friendship?"" and expresses frustration at the idea that friends should be there for each other ""no matter what."" They seem to be questioning the idea that friends should be a source of comfort and support, and suggest that they don't want to be burdened with the responsibilities of a close relationship.

Based on this information, it is possible that the poster may be struggling with depression or other mental health issues. The post suggests a sense of isolation and a lack of understanding of what it means to have close relationships, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster's reluctance to be burdened with the responsibilities of a close relationship may be a sign of avoidance or withdrawal, which are also common symptoms of depression.

However, it is important to note that this is only a possibility and not a definitive diagnosis. It is also possible that the poster is simply struggling with the idea of what it means to be a good friend, or that they have had negative experiences with friendships in the past. Without more information, it is impossible to say for certain what may be causing the poster's feelings of frustration and confusion."

The answer is yes. The poster mentions that they have struggled with depression before and that this current episode of depression is more intense and worse than previous ones.

5. Lack of career and dreams: The poster's mother gave up her career and dreams to nurture her children, which can be a source of regret and disappointment.

It is essential to note that these symptoms alone do not necessarily mean that the poster suffers from depression. However, if these feelings persist or worsen over time, it may be helpful for the poster to seek professional help from a mental health professional to address any underlying issues."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emptiness and detachment from emotions.

The overall tone of the post conveys a strong sense of hopelessness and longing, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not necessarily suffer from depression. The poster describes feeling empty and unable to emotionally connect with others, but this does not necessarily mean they are depressed. There are many possible reasons why someone might feel this way, including anxiety, burnout, or a lack of social support. It is also possible that the poster is experiencing a normal variation in mood or emotional expression.

I would say no, the poster does not suffer from depression. The poster is frustrated with a friend's behavior and is seeking advice on how to handle the situation.

The poster also mentions that they have tried talking to Jeff about the situation and that their other friends have told them not to take Jeff's behavior personally. These are all normal, healthy reactions to a frustrating situation, and they do not suggest that the poster is experiencing depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a complex mixture of emotions, indicating a potential struggle with depression. The poster acknowledges that they have made progress in their mental health, but still feels that their brain is ""fucked up"" and that they will never be truly happy. They express a discomfort with being told they are ""great"" or happy because they believe it is only in comparison to their previous state.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly exhibits emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of hopelessness, shame, and emotional defeat. They describe a lack of accomplishments and a sense of wasted years due to depression. The mention of going to bed scared and waking up disappointed indicates a significant level of emotional distress and despair. The reference to others asking about suicide and the poster's open mindset towards it, as well as already having planned it out, suggests a high level of suicidal ideation and a lack of motivation to continue living.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of abandonment and loneliness. The poster describes traumatic experiences of being abandoned by their mother, father, brother, and girlfriend, and expresses feelings of wanting to give up and feel nothing. The lack of contact with loved ones and the desire to end their life indicates a severe level of emotional distress and hopelessness commonly associated with depression. The mention of not speaking to another human for weeks and the thought that no one would know if they did something drastic further emphasizes their isolation and despair. Overall, the post displays a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.","

This is a very difficult question, as it is not appropriate to diagnose someone with a mental health condition based on a single post. However, the content of the post does suggest that the person may be experiencing some symptoms of depression, such as:

* Loss of loved ones (abandonment)
* Lack of social support (no one to talk to)
* Feelings of hopelessness and helplessness (wanting to give up and feel nothing)
* Lack of motivation (no longer trying to keep going)
* Withdrawal from social interactions (no non-work related texts in 3 weeks)

It is important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it is not always easy to recognize. It is also possible that the person may be experiencing other mental health conditions, such as anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or that they may be struggling with other challenges in their life.

If you are concerned about the person's well-being, it may be helpful to reach out to them and offer support. You could start by sending a message expressing your concern and asking how they are doing. It is important to listen to them without judgment and to validate their feelings, rather than trying to diagnose or fix their problems. You could also encourage them to seek professional help from a mental health professional or a crisis hotline."

The statement ""i just drift through this pointless life"" showcases a strong sense of hopelessness and despair, indicating a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

It is not appropriate to diagnose someone with a mental health condition based on a single statement or post. Depression is a complex condition that can manifest in many different ways, and it is not possible to accurately diagnose someone based on a brief statement or post. Additionally, it is not ethical to armchair diagnose someone without their consent, as it can be stigmatizing and can perpetuate negative stereotypes about mental health.

Instead of trying to diagnose the poster, it would be more helpful to offer support and resources. Here are some possible responses:

1. ""Sorry to hear that you're feeling that way. It can be really tough to feel disconnected and like life is pointless. Have you considered reaching out to a trusted adult or a mental health professional for support?""
2. ""I'm here to listen and offer support. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and lost sometimes. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on and how you've been feeling?""
3. ""It's understandable to feel that way sometimes, especially when life gets tough. Have you found any things that bring you joy or purpose? There are also resources available to help you cope with difficult emotions.""

Remember that everyone experiences ups and downs in life, and it is okay to struggle sometimes. By offering support and resources, you can help the poster feel seen and heard, and encourage them to seek help if they need it."

They also mention a history of cheating in their current relationship, which suggests possible self-destructive behaviors. The overall tone of the post conveys emotional distress and a sense of being overwhelmed by the complicated dynamics of their relationships. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","I'm not talking about the situation with their friend, but the way they talk about themselves and their life. They mention having a history of cheating, not knowing how to end it, and feeling lost. They also mention having short jaw length cherry red hair, which seems like an odd thing to bring up. It's possible that the poster is struggling with self-esteem issues or other mental health concerns that are contributing to their feelings of confusion and awkwardness in this situation."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits a deep sense of emotional pain, self-loathing, hopelessness, and despair. The poster expresses a belief that they are fundamentally broken and unable to fix anything in their life. They describe running away from everything and the pain that comes with self-improvement. There is a profound sense of worthlessness and a lack of identity or purpose. The mention of constant failure, social rejection, and a lack of interests, goals, relationships, or friends further emphasizes the feelings of despair and loneliness. The poster also expresses anger, bitterness, and jealousy towards others and fantasizes about violent acts, indicating a very dark and disturbed mental state. The overall tone of the post suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a high risk of self-harm or suicidal ideation, which align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of emptiness, being ""empty inside,"" and feeling like a weak person. They also mention the desire to quit smoking weed but feeling unable to do so for a drug test, which can suggest a loss of control and potential self-destructive behavior. The conversation takes a dark turn when suicide is brought up, and the poster expresses a lack of hope and meaning in life. They mention feeling depressed, lonely, and insecure while also expressing difficulty in finding joy and happiness. The overall tone of the post is filled with despair and hopelessness, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.","Answer: Yes. The poster appears to suffer from depression, as indicated by their admission of feeling lonely, insecure, and having no value to offer anyone. They also express a pessimistic view of life, suggesting that they may be struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of hopelessness. Additionally, their reference to considering suicide as a possibility suggests that they may be experiencing significant emotional distress."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of hopelessness, despair, and contemplation of suicide. The poster expresses regret for not having taken their own life, indicating a significant level of emotional distress and a belief that their life has no purpose or meaning. The statement that no matter what they do, they will always be sad suggests a deeply negative view of their current and future emotional state. This kind of extreme hopelessness and self-destructive thoughts are commonly associated with very severe depression.","

I would say that the poster does suffer from depression. The post expresses feelings of hopelessness, a lack of purpose, and a desire to end one's life, which are all common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the use of the word ""pointless"" to describe life and the statement that ""My life is going no where"" suggest a sense of helplessness and pessimism, which are also common characteristics of depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses intense emotional pain, betrayal, and despair. The poster describes their ""best friend"" ruining their life by manipulating and deceiving them, leading to a deeply hurtful and damaging romantic relationship. The poster mentions struggling with depression, anxiety, and engaging in self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm. They express a lack of ability to cope with the situation, fear of attending school due to the presence of their former friend, and potential for harmful actions towards themselves or others. These emotions and experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","If so, how does it manifest? What are the symptoms?

Based on the text, it seems that the poster may be suffering from depression. Here are some symptoms that suggest this:

1. Low self-esteem: The poster mentions that they believe they are not worth it and that nobody is going to love them. This is a common symptom of depression.
2. Anxiety: The poster mentions that they are shy and anxious around people, which is also a common symptom of depression.
3. Withdrawal: The poster mentions that they haven't seen their ""best friend"" in months and that they have been avoiding her because of the pain she caused. This is a common symptom of depression, as people may withdraw from social interactions and isolate themselves.
4. Lack of interest in activities: The poster mentions that they haven't been in a relationship before because they didn't think anyone would like them. This lack of interest in social activities and relationships is a common symptom of depression.
5. Self-harm: The poster mentions that they have been hurting themselves regularly. This is a common symptom of depression, as people may turn to self-destructive behaviors as a way to cope with their emotions.
6. Sleep disturbances: The poster mentions that they have been sleeping a lot and that they are tired all the time. This is a common symptom of depression, as people may have difficulty sleeping or may sleep too much.
7. Loss of interest in activities: The poster mentions that they have lost interest in their favorite sports and activities. This is a common symptom of depression, as people may lose interest in things that they used to enjoy.
8. Feelings of hopelessness: The poster mentions that they feel hopeless and that they don't believe that anyone can love them. This is a common symptom of depression, as people may feel a sense of hopelessness and helplessness.

It's important to note that only a qualified mental health professional can diagnose depression. However, based on the symptoms described in the text, it seems that the poster may be suffering from depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several emotions and behaviors that are indicative of depression. The poster mentions that their SO has been having ""bad episodes"" and talks about feeling the need to ""check out of the world"" during those times. This suggests a sense of emotional distress and a desire to withdraw from social contact, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster also expresses concern about their SO's lack of response and silence, despite attempts to engage in conversation. This can be seen as a reflection of the poster's anxious nature, but it also indicates a potential strain on the relationship due to their SO's depression. Overall, the post exhibits emotional distress, relationship concerns, and a sense of helplessness, which are consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","Explain your answer.

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The poster is describing their significant other who is away for work and has been experiencing bad episodes, which the poster suspects may be related to depression. However, the poster does not mention any personal experiences of depression themselves. The poster is seeking advice on how to support their significant other and manage their own anxiety during this time."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does express some negative emotions and a sense of burden in the friendship, but it does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The poster mentions feeling conflicted about their friendship and not enjoying spending time with their friend anymore, but still expresses a deep care and concern for their well-being. They also express a desire to be there for their friend if needed. This suggests that the negative emotions may stem more from the dynamics of the friendship rather than a pervasive sense of emotional distress associated with depression.","It's important to note that the OP does not mention depression, but the post does express feelings of overwhelming sadness and hopelessness."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reveals a sense of sadness and disappointment caused by the lack of birthday wishes from close friends. The poster mentions that they usually don't care about such things, but this particular incident has affected them and made them feel sad. This suggests a desire for connection and a need for acknowledgement from their friends. Although the post also acknowledges the possibility of it being perceived as attention-seeking behavior, the overall tone and emotional response indicate a level of sadness and vulnerability that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The post expresses disappointment and sadness over not receiving birthday wishes from friends, but it does not indicate any symptoms of depression. Depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyed. While the poster may be experiencing some negative emotions, their statement does not suggest that they are experiencing the persistent and debilitating symptoms of depression.

The post expresses a desire for acknowledgement and recognition from friends, which is a common human need. The fact that the poster is happy ""under their own skin"" and does not typically seek attention suggests that they are not suffering from depression. Additionally, the poster's statement does not include any language that suggests a lack of self-worth, helplessness, or a desire to harm oneself, which are common symptoms of depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys feelings of sadness, hurt, and being ignored. The poster expresses that they have not celebrated their birthday for years and have received minimal recognition from their family. The fact that their entire family went out to celebrate the birthday of a family friend and left the poster behind adds to their feelings of being excluded and ignored. The mention of getting used to being ignored suggests a resignation and acceptance of this treatment, indicating a potential pattern of low self-esteem and emotional distress. These emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not necessarily suffer from depression. While the poster expresses feelings of hurt and being ignored, which can be common symptoms of depression, there are no other indicators in the post to suggest that the poster is experiencing clinical depression.

The poster mentions that they haven't celebrated their birthday for years and that their family has been ignoring them, which could be indicative of a pattern of neglect or rejection. However, without more information, it is not possible to diagnose the poster with depression.

Additionally, the poster's statement ""people eventually get used to being ignored"" suggests that they may have developed a coping mechanism or resilience to the situation, which is not typically a characteristic of depression.

It's important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it's not always easy to identify. If you suspect that someone you know may be experiencing depression, it's important to approach the situation with sensitivity and compassion, and to encourage them to seek professional help if necessary."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not indicate strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It appears to be a question seeking advice or clarification on what to call a non-biological sister. While the content may be confusing or complicated, there is no significant expression of emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair. The tone of the post seems neutral and focused on gathering information rather than conveying overwhelming emotional distress.","

This is a question that was posed to me, and my answer was ""no"". The reason for this is that there is no indication in the text that the poster suffers from depression. The poster is simply asking for help with a family-related issue, and there is no mention of any symptoms or experiences that would suggest depression. Additionally, the tone of the text is one of confusion and seeking clarification, rather than the negative or hopeless tone that is often associated with depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post highlights the presence of fluctuations in mood, with periods of slight ups and massive downs. The poster describes feeling able to do things despite having depression, but also experiencing moments of not wanting to get out of bed and feeling overwhelmingly negative. The mention of wishing to wake up from it all and realizing it was just a dream indicates a desire to escape from the intense emotional distress associated with depression. Overall, the post demonstrates a significant impact on the individual's daily functioning and a yearning for relief, which aligns with symptoms commonly seen in depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The post mentions ""massive downs"" and ""not wanting to get out of bed,"" which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions feeling ""so negative"" and wishing they could ""just wake up from"" their current state, which are also common feelings experienced by people with depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of despair and self-doubt. The lyric mentioned by the poster suggests a preoccupation with thoughts of worthlessness and contemplating how the world would be without them. The expletive ""fuck"" following the statement indicates a negative emotional reaction. These expressions of hopelessness, self-doubt, and negative emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

This is a difficult question to answer with certainty, as depression can manifest in many different ways and can be difficult to diagnose. However, based on the content of the post, it is possible that the person may be experiencing symptoms of depression.

The lyric that the person mentions, ""I wonder how the world would be if they didn’t have me,"" suggests a sense of self-doubt and a fear of not being valued or needed. This could be a common theme for people with depression, who may struggle with feelings of worthlessness and a lack of purpose.

Additionally, the person's use of the word ""fuck"" and their statement that the lyric ""sticks with me"" could be indicative of a strong emotional response to the lyric, which is consistent with the intense emotions that people with depression may experience.

However, it's important to note that this is just a speculative interpretation based on a single post, and it's not possible to diagnose depression or any other mental health condition with certainty based on a single piece of information. It's important to approach the person with kindness and understanding, and to avoid making assumptions or judgments about their mental health."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The response ""No"" suggests that the poster does not suffer from depression. However, based on the given post, it is not possible to determine the emotional state of the poster or whether they suffer from depression. The post simply mentions making new friends in a specific location, which does not provide enough information to make an accurate judgment about their mental health.","

This is a classic example of a post that is difficult to analyze, as there is no explicit mention of depression or any other mental health issue. However, based on the content of the post, we can make some educated guesses about the poster's mental state.

Firstly, the use of the phrase ""new venusualean friends"" suggests that the poster may be feeling socially isolated or struggling to form connections with others. This could be indicative of depression, as social withdrawal and isolation are common symptoms of the condition.

Secondly, the mention of ""rabun county"" may suggest that the poster is experiencing some kind of geographical or cultural dislocation, which could also contribute to feelings of isolation and depression.

Finally, the fact that the poster is seeking out ""new venusualean friends"" suggests that they may be feeling a sense of disconnection from their current social network or support system. This could be a sign that they are struggling to find meaningful connections with others, which could be a symptom of depression.

Overall, while there is no explicit mention of depression in the post, the content suggests that the poster may be experiencing some kind of emotional distress or disconnection from others. It is important to approach the situation with sensitivity and understanding, and to offer support and resources if needed."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays strong emotions of frustration, anger, and disappointment, but it does not exhibit the core symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The individual expresses feeling overreactive and vents about a specific incident with a friend, highlighting their struggle to make and maintain friendships. While the post conveys some level of exhaustion and disillusionment with people, it does not demonstrate a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair that is typically indicative of very severe depression. The tone of the post suggests more annoyance and frustration rather than overwhelming emotional distress.","

  Yes, the poster may suffer from depression.

  No, the poster is simply frustrated with their friendship.

  It is not possible to determine based on this text.

The poster's language and tone suggest that they may be experiencing depression or at least feeling very down about their situation. The use of the word ""tired"" multiple times and the statement ""I'm so fucking tired of people and their 'you're my best friend' and 'I love you, I care about you' shit"" suggest a sense of exhaustion and disillusionment. Additionally, the poster's frustration with their friend and their perception that their friend does not care about them could be a sign of depression or low self-esteem. However, it is not possible to make a definitive diagnosis based on this text alone."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a significant amount of emotional pain and hurt. The poster expresses feeling excluded and left out by their best friend not inviting them to the engagement and not informing them about it. They also mention feeling hurt by the fact that the fiancé doesn't seem to care about their presence or feelings. The post shows a deep attachment to the friend, as they have known her for a long time, and a sense of confusion and sadness about the situation. While this post does indicate emotional distress and feelings of hurt, it does not exhibit the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, such as overwhelming exhaustion, numbness, or a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment in any activities.","I can see a few red flags here.

This is a very common question that is often asked by laypeople and mental health professionals alike. However, it's important to note that making a diagnosis based solely on a text post is not reliable and can be harmful.

That being said, there are a few red flags in the post that could potentially indicate depression or other mental health issues:

1. Withdrawal from social activities: The poster mentions that they haven't been invited to the engagement party or the wedding, which could be a sign of social isolation.
2. Difficulty with relationships: The poster mentions that the fiancé doesn't like them and their other friend, which could be a sign of relationship difficulties.
3. Emotional pain: The poster expresses feeling hurt and states that they don't know how to feel, which could be a sign of emotional distress.
4. Difficulty with self-esteem: The poster questions their own worth and value, stating that they doubt they'll be invited to the wedding and that they feel crazy for being hurt.

However, it's important to note that these red flags alone do not necessarily mean that the poster suffers from depression. There could be other factors at play, and it's important to approach the situation with sensitivity and understanding.

If you are concerned about the poster's well-being, it might be helpful to reach out to them privately and express your concern. You could ask them if they're okay and if there's anything they want to talk about. It's important to listen without judgment and to validate their feelings.

It's also important to remember that mental health is a complex issue, and it's not always possible to identify a specific diagnosis based on a single text post. It's important to approach the situation with sensitivity and understanding, and to prioritize the poster's well-being and support."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of despair and self-blame. The poster suggests that their youth has been wasted and implies a lack of fulfillment or enjoyment during this period of their life. They also express personal belief that their mental illness is a result of this wasted youth. This indicates a negative self-perception and a strong association between their mental health and their perception of their life experiences. This aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, including self-blame, hopelessness, and a negative view of oneself.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The statement ""Is youth wasted a result of mental illness or is the mental illness a result of wasted youth?"" suggests that the poster is grappling with the idea of whether their youth has been wasted due to mental illness, but it does not indicate that they are experiencing depression themselves. Additionally, the statement ""At least it looks like it in my case"" suggests that the poster is reflecting on their own experiences and is not experiencing depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on the friend's behavior and inconsistencies, and the poster's frustration with their friend's lack of honesty and dismissive responses. While there is a brief mention of the poster feeling unsure of how to proceed, it does not exhibit the profound emotional distress, hopelessness, or pervasive negative emotions commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post leans towards seeking advice and insight into the friend's behavior, rather than expressing personal emotional struggles.","

This is a classic case of ""catastrophizing"" - the tendency to interpret minor issues as major problems, and to jump to negative conclusions without sufficient evidence. The poster is making a series of assumptions about their friend's situation, without considering alternative explanations or evidence.

Here are some signs that the poster may be suffering from depression:

1. Negative thinking: The poster consistently focuses on the negative aspects of their friend's situation, and assumes the worst about their friend's abilities and intentions.
2. Jumping to conclusions: The poster jumps to conclusions without sufficient evidence, such as assuming that their friend must have had someone else do their work for them.
3. Lack of empathy: The poster does not seem to consider the possibility that their friend may be struggling with language barriers or other challenges, and instead focuses on their own frustration and confusion.
4. Difficulty with communication: The poster has difficulty communicating with their friend, and feels the need to ""bring up similar things"" multiple times.
5. Emotional reactivity: The poster's emotional response to the situation is disproportionate to the situation itself, and they feel the need to ""vent"" about their friend's behavior.

It's important to note that these signs do not necessarily mean that the poster is suffering from depression, but they are common symptoms of depression and other mental health conditions. If you are experiencing these symptoms, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness. The poster describes losing years to depression and feeling unable to cope or know how to move forward. They express a strong sense of shame and compare themselves negatively to others, feeling like the most pathetic person. The mention of struggling with depression their whole life, going to therapy for years without success, and engaging in self-destructive behaviors indicates a prolonged and severe struggle with their mental health. The overall tone of self-hatred, despair, and desperation aligns with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of apathy and disinterest in life. The poster describes a lack of engagement in activities beyond work and sleep, and mentions staring at the wall, which suggests a sense of ennui or emptiness. The phrase ""unsure about it"" adds a note of uncertainty or indecision, which could be indicative of low motivation or a lack of purpose. These symptoms align with depressive symptoms such as anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure) and lack of motivation, which suggest a potential diagnosis of depression.","

No, the poster does not necessarily suffer from depression. The statement ""All I do is work and sleep and stare at the wall"" could be a common expression of feeling unfulfilled or bored with one's current situation, rather than a symptom of depression. Additionally, the statement ""Unsure about it"" suggests that the poster may be questioning their current state of affairs, rather than experiencing the hopelessness and helplessness that is typically associated with depression. However, without more information, it is impossible to say for certain whether the poster is experiencing depression or not."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a mixture of positive emotions related to helping others and a sense of personal fulfillment and happiness derived from those experiences. The poster describes feeling uplifted and distracted from their depression when they are able to offer help or guidance to strangers. Although there is a mention of feeling upset and doubting themselves when trying to help people they know personally, this does not overshadow the overall positive emotions and sense of purpose derived from helping others. There is no indication of intense emotional pain or despair commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is generally upbeat and hopeful, with a focus on the positive impact of helping others.","Answer: Yes. The poster mentions that they have been feeling ""meh"" and have been experiencing depression. They also mention that helping strangers distracts them from their depression, which suggests that they may be experiencing depressive symptoms."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post clearly describes the poster's experience of being in a ""really dark place"" and their depressive state, which has included strong suicidal thoughts. The poster expresses feeling like an ""idiotic nobody"" and lacking a sense of worth. However, the tone of the post changes dramatically when discussing the Reddit Secret Santa gift they received. The poster describes breaking down in tears upon receiving the gift and feeling like someone cared about them. They mention feeling motivated, happy, and having a newfound sense of purpose. This significant shift in mood, from profound despair to hope and appreciation, suggests that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression. The mention of the gift potentially saving their life further emphasizes the profound impact it had on their emotional well-being.","

  Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The post mentions ""strong suicidal thoughts"" and a ""really dark place,"" which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the post expresses feelings of low self-worth and a sense of being ""an idiotic nobody,"" which are also common experiences for people with depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of hesitation and anxiety about attending therapy. The poster describes almost backing out multiple times, which suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The mention of getting the address wrong and mistakenly approaching someone else indicates a high level of anxiety and difficulty with decision-making or concentration. The overall tone of fear and discomfort suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The poster is simply nervous about attending therapy for the first time and made a mistake with the address. The use of the word ""scary"" and ""weird"" suggests that the poster is feeling anxious about the experience, but this is not necessarily a sign of depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong sense of hopelessness and despair, stating that there is no hope left and no light in their life. The poster describes going through the motions and feeling like giving up, indicating a lack of motivation and emotional exhaustion. The mention of not having the courage to end it suggests suicidal ideation or thoughts. These expressions of profound emotional distress align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly severe depression.","

  Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The post expresses a lack of hope, no light in their life, and a desire to end it, which are all common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the use of the word ""courage"" suggests that the poster may be struggling with feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, which are also common symptoms of depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair. The poster mentions feeling depressed, imploding, and considering themselves a failure. They express a lack of motivation and enjoyment in activities they used to enjoy, such as gaming. There is a clear withdrawal from social interactions and a feeling of exhaustion after minimal conversation. The mention of being in therapy and feeling stuck despite their therapist's efforts suggests a prolonged struggle with depression. The vivid metaphor of being in a vast, dark ocean without finding shore conveys a sense of being trapped and hopeless. The mention of thoughts of suicide and the belief that they will always suffer and be unhappy indicate significant emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The post describes a range of symptoms that are common in depression, including:

1. Lack of motivation and interest in activities: The poster mentions that they have no motivation to do anything and have been pulling away from people because it's exhausting to talk to them.
2. Fatigue: The poster states that they are tired all the time and have been staring at a wall for 2 hours because they don't have the energy to do anything else.
3. Sadness and hopelessness: The poster describes feeling sad, hopeless, and lost, and states that they wish they could just fall asleep and stay in their dreams.
4. Lack of future orientation: The poster mentions that they have no future ahead of them and that everything hurts.
5. Suicidal ideation: The poster mentions that some of their previous jobs have made them suicidal.

These symptoms are consistent with a major depressive episode, which is a common and treatable condition. It is important for the poster to seek professional help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional pain and despair. The poster describes feeling torn up and struggling with their depression. They question their faith and express a lack of caring about anything for a long time. The mention of wanting to lay down and escape from life indicates a strong desire for relief from their emotional distress. The overall tone of hopelessness, despair, and longing for it all to be over aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.",Why do you think this?
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses a strong sense of self-hatred and contempt. The poster states that their feelings do not want to feel anymore, suggesting a deep emotional pain and numbness. This negative self-perception and lack of emotional connection are common symptoms of depression. The overall tone of the post indicates a significant level of emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

Answer: Based on the content of the post, it is possible that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression, such as low self-esteem and a lack of motivation or interest in activities. However, it is important to note that depression can manifest in many different ways and can be difficult to diagnose based solely on a single post. It is possible that the poster may be experiencing other mental health issues or challenges that are contributing to their feelings of self-loathing and a lack of motivation. It is important to approach the situation with compassion and understanding, and to offer support and resources if the poster is open to receiving them."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster's life is unpleasant and they find solace in sleeping. They openly express a desire to avoid the reality of their life. The mention of being diagnosed with depression and anxiety suggests that they are already struggling with mental health issues. Their concern about hurting their wife's feelings implies a level of consideration and empathy towards others, which is not uncommon for individuals with depression. The overall theme of dissatisfaction with life and the use of sleep as a coping mechanism align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

This is a classic case of the ""rhetorical question fallacy."" The poster is asking for advice on how to explain their situation to their wife without hurting her feelings, but the question itself contains a bias that assumes the poster does suffer from depression. The question is phrased in a way that implies the poster's sleeping habits are a result of depression, which may not be the case.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Does the poster suffer from depression?"" is ""maybe not."" The question is based on a false premise that the poster's sleeping habits are a result of depression, and it is possible that there may be other reasons for their sleeping habits that have nothing to do with depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses deep emotional pain and betrayal. The poster shares the experience of overhearing their best friend speaking negatively about them and admitting jealousy. This revelation has deeply affected the poster, causing them to feel depressed and questioning their ability to trust others. The post conveys a sense of despair and uncertainty about how to navigate the situation and react when they next meet their friend. These emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly the feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, and a sense of hopelessness.",Why or why not?
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses feelings of anger, sadness, and being upset, which are common emotional states associated with depression. They mention being lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough breakup, which suggests a history of depressive episodes. The intense feelings of loneliness, feeling excluded from their own friend group, and the belief that they have been permanently damaged by their roommate's actions are also significant red flags for depression. These thoughts and emotions demonstrate a significant level of emotional distress and align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","Answer: Yes. The poster mentions that they were lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough breakup, and they also mention that they have been sobbing and upset for months. It is possible that the poster may be suffering from depression or another mental health condition that is contributing to their feelings of sadness and anger."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does exhibit emotional indicators that suggest the poster may be experiencing some level of depression. The poster describes feeling confused and unsure about how to handle their friend's behavior, which suggests a sense of helplessness or being overwhelmed. The mention of their friend's avoidance of discussing feelings and their own openness about their own emotions suggests a contrast in coping mechanisms, potentially indicating a deeper emotional struggle for the poster. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of concern and frustration, as well as a fear of pushing their friend further away, which aligns with the emotional distress commonly associated with depression. However, without additional information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the depression or provide a definitive label.",Answer: No. Question: Is the poster's friend depressed?

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays strong indicators of severe depression. The poster expresses a history of attempted suicide and a desire for death. They describe feeling disconnected and lacking purpose, comparing it to the empty feeling after completing a video game. The mention of being in a psych ward and the lack of willingness to overcome fear further highlights their emotional distress. The overall tone is one of hopelessness, resignation, and a strong desire for escape, which aligns with the symptoms commonly associated with severe depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Based on the text, the poster has a history of attempting suicide and has been hospitalized for it. This suggests that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition, such as depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the text does not explicitly state that the poster is depressed. It is important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it is not always easy to identify based on a single post or statement."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of envy and inconvenience, which can be signs of depression. The poster expresses feelings of jealousy towards their friend's academic success and acknowledges their own negative behavior, such as helping their friend with assignments despite it affecting their own grades. They also express a desire to end the friendship due to these negative emotions. This overall emotional state suggests a possible link to depression, as it involves feelings of inadequacy and a desire to distance oneself from others.","The reason I ask is that they mention feeling inconvenienced and jealous of their friend's success, which could be symptoms of depression. Additionally, the fact that they don't care about being seen as a ""toxic friend"" or ""bad guy"" suggests that they may be experiencing negative emotions that are causing them to act in a harmful way. It's important to note that depression can manifest in different ways, and not everyone who experiences depression will show the same symptoms. It's possible that the poster is simply feeling overwhelmed or frustrated with their situation, rather than experiencing full-blown depression. However, it's important to consider the possibility that the poster may be struggling with their mental health, and to offer support and resources if they are."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays significant signs of emotional distress and potentially indicates depression. The poster expresses feelings of loneliness, stating that they do not have many close friends and that they are losing the ones they do have. They describe feeling neglected and as though their friends no longer care about them. These feelings of isolation and being unimportant can be indicative of depression. The poster also discusses feeling disappointed and neglected, which aligns with symptoms of depression such as low self-esteem and a lack of fulfillment in interpersonal relationships. The overall tone of the post is one of sadness, despair, and a desire for advice and insight, further suggesting that the poster may be suffering from depression.",
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster experiences a significant life event and emotions associated with it, such as shock and excitement, there is no mention of profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post is positive and focused on the newfound relationship with the poster's sisters, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress.",Why or why not?
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reflects a profound sense of emotional pain and numbness. The poster describes a lack of interest or enjoyment in anything, including their favorite shows, hobbies, and people they used to like. They express a deep sense of emptiness and a feeling that the things that made them who they are have disappeared. The post conveys a strong resistance to the common suggestion of engaging in activities one enjoys, as the poster states they do not like or care about anything. There is also mention of trying medication and therapy without success. The overall tone is one of hopelessness, frustration, and a desire to feel again, with a hint of despair and thoughts of not wanting to wait much longer. These emotions and experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, despair, and hopelessness. The poster describes a significant decline in their mental health since joining the military, including symptoms such as insomnia, loss of joy, and intense hatred towards the world. They express frustration and disappointment with the lack of support from the military, as evidenced by the dismissive responses they received from the chaplain and higher-ups. The mention of a previous suicide incident being ignored suggests a lack of care for the well-being of service members. The overall tone of desperation, isolation, and the desire to be ""normal"" again aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

Answer: Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. They mention that they have not been their ""normal self"" for almost 3 years, and that they hate the world and everything in it. They also mention that they have asked for help before but were told to ""suck it up and move on,"" which is a common experience for people with depression. Additionally, they mention that they have experienced a loss of joy and happiness, and that they feel overwhelmed by their situation. All of these symptoms are consistent with depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of depression. The poster mentions being unemployed for over a year and feeling depressed during that time. They express feelings of social anxiety, depression, and a lack of comfort with giving references due to past job abandonment. The mention of a ""massive gap"" in their resume that they can't explain highlights the challenges they face in finding employment. Overall, the post conveys a sense of hopelessness, low self-esteem, and difficulty in overcoming their depression symptoms, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. They mention experiencing ""social anxiety and depression"" and having a ""massive gap in [their] resume that [they] can't explain."" These statements suggest that the poster has been struggling with depression and has had difficulty maintaining employment as a result. Additionally, the fact that they mention feeling ""so depressed"" that they haven't done anything since leaving school in 2016 further supports the idea that they may be experiencing depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is experiencing a struggle or conflict. The phrase ""fall back in"" implies a temptation or pull towards something negative or harmful. This can be interpreted as a reference to depressive thoughts or behaviors. The statement ""easier to fall back in than to fight against it"" suggests a sense of resignation or feeling overwhelmed by the effort required to resist negative emotions or behaviors. This aligns with the characteristic of depression where individuals may feel trapped or powerless in the face of their difficulties.","

I would not say that the poster suffers from depression based on this statement alone. The statement could be interpreted as a reference to the ease of falling into a particular behavior or pattern, rather than a mental health condition like depression. Additionally, it's important to avoid making assumptions about people based on a single statement or post, as this can be misleading and stigmatizing. It's possible that the poster may be experiencing a range of emotions or challenges, and it's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post portrays a strong sense of emotional distress and betrayal. The poster describes feeling deeply hurt and betrayed by their best friend, who spread false and hurtful rumors about their relationship. The impact of these rumors on the poster's personal and professional life is significant, leading to workplace mockery and even blaming the end of the relationship on shallow reasons. The emotional response of feeling betrayed, wanting to cut off the friend from their life, and seeking advice on whether their reaction is justified indicates a high level of emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

1. The poster mentions that they have been through a ""nasty split"" with their fiance, which suggests that they have experienced a significant loss and may be struggling with emotional pain.
2. The poster describes feeling ""betrayed"" by their friend's actions, which is a common symptom of depression.

4. The poster's desire to ""completely cut"" their friend from their life and their statement that they ""can't imagine ever reconciling"" suggests a level of emotional intensity and rigidity that is consistent with depression.
5. The poster's request for ""impartial"" advice and their statement that they are looking for advice from ""impartial people"" suggests that they may be feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about how to handle the situation, which is a common symptom of depression.

It's important to note that depression can manifest in many different ways, and not everyone who experiences depression will exhibit all of these symptoms. However, based on the information provided in the post, it seems likely that the poster may be struggling with depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress and guilt. The poster admits to making a serious mistake driven by their depression and existential crisis. They express fear of losing their girlfriend, who they consider to be their only source of happiness and reason for existing. This dependence on their girlfriend for happiness and the belief that they don't deserve her suggest issues with self-esteem and a significant emotional reliance on external factors for their well-being. The overall tone of hopelessness, desperation, and self-blame aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.",Please explain your answer.

However, towards the end of the post, the poster shares a personal story that gave them hope and purpose, implying that they may have experienced a few moments of positivity amidst their struggles. Despite this glimmer of hope, the overall tone and content of the post strongly suggest a significant level of emotional distress.","

Additionally, they mention having suicidal thoughts, which is a serious symptom of depression.

"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of hurt and disappointment in the potential loss of a long-term friendship. The poster expresses confusion and frustration over their friend's sudden lack of communication and seeks to understand if they have done something to upset her. There is a mention of feeling hurt and missing the friend, but it does not display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post seems more focused on relationship dynamics and potential resolutions rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress.",Please provide reasons for your answer.
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reveals a history of suicide attempts, which is a strong indicator of severe depression. The poster mentions being in therapy and taking medication, indicating ongoing treatment for their mental health. Despite some improvement in anxiety and sleep, they express a belief that they will never overcome depression and have learned to live with it. This suggests a sense of hopelessness and resignation, typical of severe depression.

The overall tone of the post is one of despair, self-doubt, and emotional fog, indicating a significant level of emotional distress consistent with severe depression.","

4. Anxiety: The poster mentions taking anxiety meds and experiencing anxiety, which is a common symptom of depression.
5. Lack of motivation: The poster mentions feeling lost and not knowing where to go from here, which suggests a lack of motivation and purpose.

It's important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and not everyone will experience all of these symptoms. However, based on the information provided in the post, it seems likely that the poster is struggling with depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and a comparison between the poster's difficulties in making money and the apparent ease of others. This suggests a feeling of inadequacy and possibly low self-worth, which can be indicators of depression. The mention of reading success stories on Reddit and perceiving everyone as a millionaire could also contribute to feelings of hopelessness or envy, further supporting the possibility of depression. Overall, the post highlights negative emotions and a negative perception of oneself, indicating a potential presence of depression.","

The question is based on the assumption that the poster is struggling with financial difficulties and is feeling frustrated and envious of others who seem to be successful. The question is also based on the assumption that the poster is comparing themselves to others and feeling inadequate.

It is possible that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression, such as low self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness, and a lack of motivation. However, it is important to note that depression can manifest in many different ways and can be triggered by a variety of factors. It is also possible that the poster may be experiencing other emotional or psychological issues, such as anxiety or stress, that are contributing to their feelings of frustration and envy.

To answer the question, it is important to consider the context of the post and the language used. For example, if the poster is using language that suggests they are feeling overwhelmed or helpless, such as ""I'll never be able to make money like everyone else,"" this may be a sign of depression or other mental health issues. Additionally, if the poster is comparing themselves to others and feeling envious or resentful, this may also be a sign of depression or other emotional issues.

It is important to approach the question with sensitivity and understanding, and to avoid making assumptions or judgments about the poster's mental health. Instead, it may be helpful to offer support and resources, such as counseling or financial advice, that can help the poster address their financial struggles and improve their overall well-being."

The poster expresses a deep sense of emptiness and lack of meaning in life, describing a perpetual feeling of weight and a gravitational pull that prevents them from wanting anything meaningful. They state that they simply don't want to exist, regardless of their current circumstances or potential future opportunities. The post also highlights a belief that their lack of desire for a fulfilling career, romantic relationships, or parenthood makes them unworthy of pursuing these aspects of life. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-deprecation, and the desire for affirmation from others aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional vulnerability and a desire for connection and validation from others. The poster acknowledges that they are having a rough time and offers to exchange compliments with others who may also be struggling. The mention of feeling like things aren't looking too good and the promise to respond to each and every person who comments suggests a personal need for emotional support and affirmation.

"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes deep resentment and depression when thinking back to their childhood. They express feeling ignored, neglected, and overshadowed by their younger sister, leading to feelings of sadness and frustration. The poster mentions how these experiences have haunted them for years and affected their ability to function. The post also includes examples of disappointing and hurtful incidents involving their sister's behavior and their mother's favoritism. These experiences have likely contributed to the poster's feelings of depression and resentment. The overall tone of the post suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a need for validation or reassurance regarding their emotions, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","I do not have depression, but i do get depressed. And when i do, i can't do anything for weeks at a time. I've been this way since i was 12. And it's been 8 years now. I just feel so much anger and resentment towards my mom. And i feel like she doesn't deserve it, because she's been nice to me, but she never made up for what she did to me when i was a child. And i feel like it's all justified. I just want to know if i'm overreacting, or if i have a legit reason to feel this way. I know it's not healthy, but i can't seem to shake it off. And i've tried therapy, but it doesn't seem to be working. So, i'm hoping someone here can help me. Thank you for reading.""

It sounds like you have a legitimate reason to feel upset and resentful towards your mother based on the experiences you described. It's understandable that you would feel this way, especially since your mother's behavior towards you changed significantly after the birth of your sister and you were essentially pushed aside.

It's important to recognize that your mother's actions were not intentional and were likely motivated by her own emotions and needs at the time. However, this does not negate the impact that her actions had on you. It's possible that your mother was overwhelmed with the birth of a new baby and may not have realized the extent to which her behavior was affecting you.

It's also important to recognize that your feelings of anger and resentment are valid and do not make you a bad person. It's okay to feel these emotions, and it's important to allow yourself to feel them in a healthy way.

It may be helpful to consider seeking out therapy or counseling to work through these feelings and to find healthy ways to manage them. A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space for you to process your emotions and work through the experiences you described.

Additionally, it may be helpful to practice self-care and prioritize your own needs and well-being. This can include engaging in activities that bring you joy, setting boundaries with others, and taking time for yourself to relax and recharge.

Overall, it's important to recognize that your feelings are valid and to prioritize your own well-being. It's okay to feel upset and resentful, and it's important to allow yourself to feel these emotions in a healthy way."

This is a speculative question, and it's not appropriate to diagnose someone with depression based on a single post. However, there are a few reasons why the poster might have reacted the way they did:

1. Embarrassment: The poster's friend might have been embarrassed to admit that they were struggling to make new friends, and therefore dismissed the suggestion as a way of avoiding the topic.
2. Defensiveness: The friend might have felt defensive about their social life and perceived the suggestion as an attack or a judgment.
3. Fear of rejection: The friend might have been afraid that if they pursued the suggestion, they would be rejected or not successful.
4. Lack of self-confidence: The friend might have lacked confidence in their ability to make new friends and therefore dismissed the suggestion as a way of avoiding the perceived risk of failure.

It's important for the poster to approach the situation with sensitivity and understanding, and to be prepared to offer support and resources if their partner is struggling with depression. It's also important for the poster to take care of themselves and prioritize their own well-being, as being in a relationship with someone who may be depressed can be emotionally challenging."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a range of strong emotions including hurt, betrayal, apathy, and feelings of being unimportant or unloved. The poster describes a significant change in their friendship dynamic after their best friend got a boyfriend, leading to feelings of being ignored and unimportant. They express their efforts to communicate their feelings and concerns to their friend, but it seems to have been met with apathy and dismissiveness. The poster also reflects on their past experiences and their role as the one who constantly cared and cried for their friend, questioning if their friend ever reciprocated these feelings. The mention of crying, worrying, and feeling confused and angry indicates a high level of emotional distress and turmoil. The overall tone of the post suggests deep emotional pain, disappointment, and a sense of loss, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","I'd say yes, and here's why. The poster seems to be suffering from depression due to the following reasons: 1.

This suggests that the poster lacks self-esteem and may feel unworthy of being treated well by others. 2. Need for validation: The poster seeks validation from their friend, as evident from the line ""I wonder if she cried for me, at least once?"" This indicates that the poster needs validation from others to feel good about themselves. 3. Emotional sensitivity: The poster is easily hurt by their friend's actions and feels emotional pain, as evident from the line ""It hurted me."" This suggests that the poster is emotionally sensitive. 4. Self-blame: The poster blames themselves for the breakdown of the friendship, as evident from the line ""I got fed up, starting to blame myself because I always accepted all of her bullshit."" This is a common symptom of depression, where individuals blame themselves for things that are not their fault. 5. Withdrawal: The poster has withdrawn from their friend and is no longer engaging with them, as evident from the line ""I broke our friendship, leaving her confused and perhaps angry at me."" This is a common symptom of depression, where individuals withdraw from social interactions. In conclusion, the poster seems to be suffering from depression due to their lack of self-esteem, need for validation, emotional sensitivity, self-blame, and withdrawal from social interactions. It is important for the poster to seek professional help to address these issues and improve their mental health."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is experiencing depression despite having good life circumstances.

Despite having a period of improvement and doing well in a recent semester, the poster now feels terrified and low again, indicating a relapse or worsening of their depression symptoms. The plea for advice and the mention of regaining faith in oneself further demonstrate the emotional struggles and lack of hope commonly associated with depression.",
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not provide strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily expresses feelings of loneliness and seeking advice on how to make new friends. While loneliness can be a symptom of depression, in this case, the post does not indicate a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or lack of fulfillment. The tone of the post seems more focused on finding solutions and seeking support rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress.",Why or why not?

5. Mention of feeling lonely: The poster mentions that they feel lonely and that they wish they could spend more time with their parents, which is a common symptom of depression.

It's important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it's not always easy to identify. However, based on the text, it appears that the poster may be experiencing some symptoms of depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does mention the poster's cousin having depression and anxiety, but it primarily focuses on the poster's desire to restore their lost friendship.

The poster acknowledges their own lack of confidence, charisma, and popularity in comparison to their brother. They also mention feeling hurt and that their pride is affected by this comparison. While there may be some underlying self-esteem issues, the emotions expressed in the post do not seem to reach the level of very severe depression. The focus is primarily on the specific situation and seeking validation or shared experiences from others, rather than conveying a pervasive sense of hopelessness or emotional distress.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The post is a lighthearted admission of feeling embarrassed by their younger brother's popularity and coolness. The poster acknowledges their own lack of popularity and coolness, but also highlights their strengths in organization and academic achievement. There is no indication of self-loathing, hopelessness, or other symptoms of depression. The post is simply a humorous and relatable expression of sibling rivalry."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of emotions and a sense of numbness that has lasted for over a month. The poster mentions struggling with depression in the past and finding happiness through a new relationship. However, the relationship abruptly ended with the girl pretending to commit suicide. This traumatic event has had a profound impact on the poster's emotional state, resulting in a complete loss of feeling. The combination of preexisting depression, the sudden loss of a significant source of happiness, and the traumatic experience of being deceived and lied to contribute to the likelihood of the poster suffering from depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. Here's why:

1. They mention that they haven't felt anything in over a month, which is a common symptom of depression. People with depression may experience a lack of emotions, including happiness, sadness, and excitement.
2. The poster mentions that they have struggled with depression for a few years, which suggests that they have a history of depression.
3. The poster mentions that they were doing well until they met someone online who made them feel happy, but then that person disappeared and left them feeling devastated. This suggests that the poster may have been experiencing a form of emotional dependence or attachment, which can be a common symptom of depression.
4. The poster mentions that they feel nothing anymore after the person they met online disappeared. This lack of emotional response could be a sign of depression.

Overall, based on the information provided in the post, it seems likely that the poster suffers from depression. However, it's important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it's always best to consult a mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys deep emotional pain, trauma, and distress. The poster shares a history of being molested at a young age and confesses to not having dealt with it effectively until now. They express feeling terrified, dirty, and used, and resorting to self-harm as a way to cope with the pain. The mention of wanting to hear something nice suggests a desperate need for support and validation. These intense and distressing emotions, coupled with self-destructive behaviors, point to a high likelihood of the poster suffering from depression.","

Answer: Based on the information provided in the post, it is possible that the poster may suffer from depression. The post mentions feelings of terror, feeling dirty and used, and self-harming behaviors (cutting), which are all common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the fact that the poster has never attempted to deal with the trauma of being molested and is now experiencing these negative emotions at the age of 27 suggests that they may be struggling with the aftermath of the trauma. However, it is important to note that depression can manifest in many different ways and can be caused by a variety of factors, so it is not possible to definitively say that the poster suffers from depression based on this information alone."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a variety of emotions that are commonly associated with depression, such as anger, frustration, and a sense of hopelessness. The poster describes their negative feelings towards their great uncle, highlighting his negative traits and criminal behavior. These emotions are further exacerbated by the news of their great uncle's death. The mention of the poster's concern for their younger siblings' safety and their great grandfather's burden of cleaning up their great uncle's mess adds to the overall tone of distress and emotional strain. The post conveys a lack of empathy or connection to their great uncle's death, which can be a symptom of depression. Overall, the negative emotions, lack of empathy, and feeling overwhelmed by the situation align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The language and content of the post suggest that the poster is expressing frustration and anger towards their great uncle, rather than depression. The use of strong language and the statement ""I may be the only person to not see this as a 'loss'"" suggest that the poster is not experiencing sadness or depression. Additionally, the post is focused on the negative aspects of the great uncle's behavior and the impact it had on the family, rather than the emotional state of the poster."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a significant distress and preoccupation with the poster's appearance. They describe a long-standing struggle with their self-image, feeling like a monster when they look in the mirror, and being self-critical of their facial features. The comparison to conventionally attractive women, the belief that they will never be considered beautiful, and the feeling of being gawked at in public all indicate a negative perception of oneself. The mention of feeling ill when imagining how others perceive them and the desire for cosmetic surgery further demonstrate a deep dissatisfaction with their appearance. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-hatred, and feeling undeserving suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

I'm sorry, but I don't think the person in the post suffers from depression. Here's why:

1. The post is written in a very negative and critical way, but it doesn't express any feelings of hopelessness or helplessness, which are common symptoms of depression.
2. The person in the post is focused on their physical appearance and body image issues, which is a common issue for many people, but it doesn't necessarily indicate depression.
3. The person in the post mentions that they don't have enough money to get cosmetic surgery, which suggests that they are more preoccupied with their appearance than with any underlying mental health issues.
4. The post doesn't mention any other symptoms that are commonly associated with depression, such as changes in appetite, sleep patterns, or energy levels.

Overall, while the person in the post may be experiencing low self-esteem and body dissatisfaction, it doesn't seem like they are suffering from depression based on the information provided in the post."

Overall, the post conveys a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and a lack of emotional fulfillment that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of self-doubt and negative self-perception. The poster states that even when someone says something nice to them, they cannot believe it is genuine and instead attribute it to pity.

The mention of depression acting as a filter that turns any positive stimulus into something negative further supports the presence of depressive symptoms. Overall, the post reflects a pessimistic and negative mindset regarding oneself, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

Answer: Based on the content of the post, it is likely that the poster suffers from depression. The post mentions that the person has difficulty believing positive comments and assumes they are out of pity, which is a common symptom of depression.

While there is some mention of feeling annoyed and confused, it lacks the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post is more centered around seeking advice and understanding the dynamics of the friendship rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress.","I don't think so.

The expression of wanting to send a long, heartfelt apology letter highlights their desperation to mend the relationship. The overall tone and content of the post display emotional turmoil and self-blame, which are consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","If so, how does that impact their situation?

Yes, the poster may suffer from depression based on the text. They mention having problems with other friends, family, and university, which could be indicative of depression. Additionally, they mention feeling ""depressed"" and ""having a depressive state"" in the text.

Their depression may impact their situation in a few ways:

1. Mood swings: Depression can cause mood swings, which may have led to the poster's inconsistent behavior towards their friend. They may have been more irritable or short-tempered with their friend, which could have contributed to the breakdown of their friendship.
2. Lack of motivation: Depression can also make it difficult to motivate oneself to do things, which may have led to the poster's lack of response to their friend's attempts to communicate.
3. Distorted thinking: Depression can also lead to distorted thinking patterns, such as all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization. This may have contributed to the poster's negative self-talk and belief that they have ruined their friendship beyond repair.

It's important to note that depression is a treatable condition, and seeking professional help can be beneficial in managing symptoms and improving relationships. If the poster suspects that they may be experiencing depression, it may be helpful for them to seek support from a mental health professional.

In terms of the letter, it may be helpful for the poster to send it, but they should be prepared for the possibility that their friend may not respond or may not be willing to forgive them immediately. It's important to respect their friend's boundaries and give them space if they need it. The poster may also want to consider seeking professional help to address their depression and work on improving their communication skills."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post highlights the lack of personal hygiene and the struggle to engage in basic self-care activities like showering and washing. The poster expresses a lack of motivation and energy to complete these tasks, despite not wanting to feel dirty or unkempt. This sense of apathy and difficulty in carrying out daily activities is indicative of the experience commonly associated with depression. The mention of spending most of the day in bed and feeling like they cannot help it further suggests a lack of motivation and involvement in daily life, which aligns with depressive symptoms. Overall, the post conveys a sense of emotional distress and a significant impact on the poster's ability to take care of themselves, indicating the presence of depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. This post is a rant about personal hygiene, and the author is expressing frustration with their lack of motivation to shower and engage in self-care activities. While the post does mention feeling like a ""nasty bitch"" and being ""unkempt,"" there is no mention of feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest in activities that are typical symptoms of depression. Additionally, the author mentions that they can get up to do things they enjoy on good days, which suggests that their lack of motivation is not due to a persistent low mood."

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The poster describes experiencing depression, feeling hopeless, and having a lack of self-worth, which are all common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions that they have tried various strategies to overcome procrastination but nothing has worked, which suggests that their struggles may be more deeply rooted in their mental health."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The response is based on the limited information provided in the post, which is simply a statement about a product or service called ""Monalove."" There is no clear indication of the poster's emotional state or any mention of depression symptoms. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the poster suffers from depression based on this post alone.","

Answer: No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The phrase ""Monalove make your Love visible"" is a play on words, combining the name of a popular dating app (Tinder) with the idea of making one's love visible to others. The poster is likely using this phrase as a way to express their enthusiasm for the app and the potential for finding love through it, rather than as a reflection of any personal struggles or emotional state."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a significant level of regret, self-blame, and feelings of worthlessness. The poster expresses a strong desire to have done things differently in the past, particularly in high school, and blames themselves for their current situation. They describe themselves as feeling like a ""huge goddamn retard"" and express hatred towards themselves. These emotions indicate a low self-esteem and a sense of hopelessness about their current circumstances. The post also hints at a lack of social connections and loneliness, as they mention not having any friends currently and believing that attending a university out of high school would have allowed them to have friends by now. Overall, the tone of the post is filled with self-criticism, regret, and discontent, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not seem to suffer from depression. While they express feelings of regret and disappointment about their past choices and performance, they do not exhibit the persistent and pervasive symptoms of depression, such as a lack of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, or suicidal thoughts. The poster's feelings of self-doubt and frustration are common and normal reactions to difficult life experiences, and they do not necessarily indicate the presence of a mental health condition like depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of sadness, disappointment, and loneliness regarding their parents' lack of involvement and support in their college journey. They describe feeling unrecognized and ignored by their family, highlighting a deep need for validation and acknowledgement. The mention of questioning whether to visit home or not and feeling awkward making excuses suggests a sense of detachment from their family and a lack of emotional connection. These feelings of abandonment and indifference align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.","I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but rather your own subjective interpretation of the text. Do you think the poster might be experiencing depression or other emotional issues? Why or why not?"
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of hopelessness, isolation, and a lack of trust in others. The poster expresses the belief that nobody can be relied upon, including one's own shadow, which symbolizes constant companionship and support. This sense of abandonment and permanence in darkness suggests a deep emotional distress and a feeling of being trapped or unable to escape from negative feelings or situations. These feelings align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

I would say no, the poster does not suffer from depression. The statement ""Never rely on anyone, for even your own shadow leaves you when you are in darkness"" is a metaphorical expression that can be interpreted in various ways, but it does not necessarily indicate depression.

The statement could be seen as a cautionary message about the unreliability of others, or a reminder to be self-sufficient and not to rely too heavily on others. It could also be interpreted as a commentary on the impermanence of relationships and the fleeting nature of human connections.

While the statement could potentially be related to depression if taken in a certain context, it is not a clear indication of depression on its own. It is important to avoid making assumptions about someone's mental health based on a single statement or post, as depression can manifest in many different ways and can be difficult to diagnose. If you are concerned about someone's well-being, it is important to approach the situation with sensitivity and to ask them directly if they are okay."

The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking information and clarifying legal and logistical questions.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a sense of anger and resentment towards parents for their mortality and for not considering the emotional burden their death would impose on their children. This suggests a deep sense of emotional pain and potentially unresolved grief. The mention of assuming love only runs one way and the expression of feeling as though sons and daughters cannot have a strong love for their parents indicate a complex and conflicting emotional state. While the post does not explicitly mention depression, the underlying emotions of anger, grief, and a questioning of parental love suggest a level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

Answer: Based on the content of the post, it is possible that the poster may suffer from depression or other mental health issues. The post expresses feelings of anger and resentment towards parents who have passed away, and the language used suggests that the poster may be struggling with negative emotions. Additionally, the post raises questions about the fairness of life and the nature of love, which are common themes in depression.

The overall tone and content of the post align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The post is filled with emotions of sadness, loss, and hopelessness, which are common symptoms of depression. The fact that the poster has been in a ""terrible depressive spell for the last few weeks"" and that the loss of their pet has ""ruined everything"" suggests that they may be struggling with depression.

The fact that the poster is able to recognize that their friend's behavior is not consistent with their words and is able to articulate their concerns suggests that they are not experiencing depression. Additionally, the poster is seeking advice on how to determine if their friend is sincere, which is not a typical symptom of depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

However, it is important to note that this post does not provide enough information to definitively diagnose depression. The focus is primarily on the specific issue of not caring for the stepchild, rather than displaying a wider range of symptoms commonly associated with depression. Further assessment and understanding of the poster's overall emotional state would be necessary for a more accurate identification.","Why or why not?

  Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. Here's why:

1. Lack of empathy: The poster does not seem to have any empathy for their stepchild, which is a common symptom of depression.
2. Negative feelings: The poster expresses negative feelings towards their stepchild, such as not caring about them and not wanting to be around them. This is another common symptom of depression.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of self-criticism and dissatisfaction with the poster's physical appearance and weight gain. The mention of medication side effects and comfort eating suggests a potential link between emotional distress and the change in eating habits.

This demonstrates a level of self-awareness and a desire to make changes, but the overall tone still conveys a sense of disappointment and negative self-perception. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, specifically relating to body image and self-esteem issues.","

This is a classic case of depression. The poster mentions that they have been eating comfort foods and have gained weight due to medication side effects, but they also mention that they have been exercising regularly. This is a common symptom of depression, where individuals may engage in self-destructive behaviors such as overeating or undereating, despite their best efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, the poster's negative self-talk and self-blame (e.g. ""I'm fat,"" ""I'm a failure"") are also indicative of depression. It is important for the poster to seek professional help to address their depression and develop a healthier relationship with food and exercise."

The poster expresses a desire for their friend to find someone better and questions her reasons for staying in such a damaging relationship. Despite feeling conflicted about how to address the situation, the overall tone of the post does not convey the typically associated symptoms of very severe depression. The focus is primarily on the friend's relationship and the poster's struggle with how to support her rather than expressing profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues.","Answer: Yes, the poster seems to suffer from depression.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of frustration, despair, and isolation. The poster expresses a strong desire for others to understand the experience of depression and highlights the lack of empathy and support they receive from people who don't truly comprehend the nature of depression.

While the emotions expressed in the post align with some depressive symptoms, the intensity and overall tone of the post do not suggest very severe depression. The focus on the impact of the friend's achievements and comparison to their own life is more specific to feelings of jealousy and self-doubt, rather than overwhelming emotional distress often associated with severe depression.","

It's important to remember that you're not alone and that there are people who care about you and want to help.

This is a tricky one! The poster does express some negative feelings and regrets, but it's not necessarily a clear-cut case of depression. Here's why:

The poster mentions ""missing their old self"" and feeling like they've wasted time on the internet, but they don't mention any persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed. They also use strong language and express frustration, which can be a normal response to feeling overwhelmed or frustrated with life circumstances.

That being said, it's possible that the poster could be experiencing some symptoms of depression, such as low self-esteem or a sense of hopelessness, but without more information, it's difficult to say for sure.

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The post is written in a straightforward and matter-of-fact tone, with the author expressing their emotions and seeking advice on how to deal with the situation. There is no mention of any symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or a lack of interest in activities that the author may be experiencing. Additionally, the author is seeking advice and support from others, which is not typically a behavior associated with depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post poses a moral dilemma and asks for opinions on whether someone would continue to be friends with someone they planned to rob. There is no indication of emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression. The focus of the post is on a specific situation and seeking advice, rather than expressing deep emotional pain or hopelessness.","

I don't think the poster suffers from depression. The question they have asked is a hypothetical one, and it doesn't seem to be related to any personal struggles or emotional issues. The poster is simply asking for other people's opinions on a hypothetical situation, and their wording doesn't suggest any signs of depression.

However, I do think the poster may be experiencing some financial difficulties or stress, as they have mentioned that they need money urgently. This may be why they are considering robbing their old friend's house, as a desperate attempt to solve their financial problems. But again, this is just a hypothesis, and there could be other reasons why the poster is asking this question."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a significant level of emotional distress and vulnerability. The poster reveals that they have struggled with depression for several years and have experienced both highs and lows. Despite recently feeling okay and having supportive relationships, they describe a distressing encounter with a stranger that deeply impacted them. The poster expresses feelings of hurt, shock, and a sense of being perceived negatively by others. They also mention breaking down and crying after the incident. This emotional reaction, combined with the vulnerability expressed throughout the post, suggests a strong possibility of depression.",Is the poster male? Is the poster's girlfriend still in a relationship with him? Does the poster have a high self-esteem?
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of motivation, drive, and interest in activities, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster has tried antidepressants and looked into other causes of their symptoms, indicating a prolonged struggle with their emotional state. The mention of sleeping excessively, difficulty in studying or doing work, and contemplating suicide are significant indicators of a severe emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of hopelessness, despair, and thoughts of wanting to opt out of life align with symptoms commonly seen in individuals suffering from depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The poster mentions feeling lost, having no motivation or drive, and experiencing suicidal thoughts, all of which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the fact that the poster has tried various solutions, such as antidepressants and thyroid and vitamin level checks, suggests that they have been experiencing these symptoms for some time and have been seeking help. It is important for the poster to continue seeking professional help and support to address their depression and improve their quality of life."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates a deep sense of despair, emotional pain, and hopelessness. The poster reaches out to their ex, who is the only person they feel comfortable speaking to about their depression and suicidal thoughts. However, their ex dismisses their concerns and tells them to seek professional help instead. The poster expresses feeling abandoned and betrayed by the only person they trusted, leading to a volatile mix of anger, sadness, and a desire to end their life as a final act of defiance. The post reveals a significant level of emotional distress, self-destructive thoughts, and a lack of supportive relationships, all of which align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. The text mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""depression,"" and the tone is one of hopelessness and despair. Additionally, the fact that the poster has confided in an ex about their depression and suicidal thoughts suggests that they may be struggling with their mental health."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression. It primarily focuses on the poster seeking new friends who share specific qualities and interests. While there is a mention of being able to debate and push one's point stubbornly, it does not convey the emotional pain, exhaustion, or lack of enjoyment typically associated with depression. The tone of the post seems more casual and focused on finding like-minded individuals rather than expressing significant emotional distress.","

It's important to note that this is just a hypothetical scenario, and I do not have access to any personal information or context. However, based on the text of the post, it is possible to make some inferences about the poster's mental health.

The request for ""no filter"" and the ability to ""debate and push your point stubbornly even if you're wrong"" could suggest that the poster is seeking out people who are comfortable engaging in assertive and potentially confrontational interactions. This could be an indication that the poster may be experiencing feelings of insecurity or low self-esteem, as they may be seeking validation or a sense of control through these interactions.

Additionally, the mention of ""offensive topics and subjects"" could suggest that the poster may have a higher tolerance for controversial or inappropriate content, which could be a sign of a lack of emotional regulation or a need for excitement and stimulation.

However, it's important to note that these are just speculations based on the text of the post, and it's impossible to make a definitive diagnosis without more information. It's also possible that the poster is simply looking for like-minded individuals with a similar sense of humor and a willingness to engage in playful banter. Ultimately, it's important to approach any online interactions with kindness and respect, and to avoid making assumptions about others based on limited information."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post acknowledges experiencing depression and seeks advice on healthy coping mechanisms.

This post demonstrates a level of self-awareness and desire for healthier coping mechanisms, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The poster is simply asking for suggestions on healthy coping mechanisms for dealing with depression.

"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with the friendship, particularly due to the friend's busy schedule and lack of availability for activities. The mention of the friend pressuring the poster to engage in ""double dates"" and couples activities despite the poster's discomfort and different type of relationship indicates a lack of understanding and compatibility in values. While the post does convey some negative emotions, such as feeling like they are in different places in life and questioning the future of the friendship, it does not exhibit the profound emotional distress typically associated with very severe depression. Overall, the focus of the post is more on evaluating the friendship rather than expressing intense emotional pain.","It is not uncommon for people with depression to struggle with social relationships, including friendships. The poster's desire to end a 6-year friendship over a disagreement about activity choices and the fact that they feel their values are no longer aligned could be a sign of depression. Additionally, the fact that the poster has been single for 5 years and has been in a ""situationship"" for 18 months could also be indicative of depression. It is important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and not everyone will experience the same symptoms. It is also important to note that depression is a treatable condition, and seeking professional help can be beneficial. It is not wrong of the poster to not want to be friends with someone who does not share their values and priorities. It is okay to prioritize one's own well-being and to set boundaries in relationships. However, it may be worth considering whether there are other factors at play that are contributing to the desire to end the friendship. It may be helpful to speak with a therapist or trusted friend or family member to explore these feelings and to determine the best course of action."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, fear, and hopelessness. The poster describes the worsening of their depression, to the point where they are afraid of their own thoughts and have thoughts of not wanting to wake up from sleep. They also share their recent experiences of losing two important people in their life, which has contributed to their depression worsening. The mention of almost taking their own life due to the actions of their ex/best friend and their fear of losing the new person they fell in love with indicates a significant emotional distress and possible self-esteem issues. The overall tone of hopelessness, despair, and the belief that no one would notice or care if they were gone suggests a level of emotional distress commonly associated with depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. They mention that they have been battling depression for 13 years and that it has been getting worse lately. They also mention feeling hopeless and considering not waking up from sleep, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions that they have lost two people they cared about recently, which could have triggered their depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not provide enough information to determine whether the poster suffers from depression. It simply states that the poster needs advice, without any specific emotional indicators or details about their situation. Without more context, it is not possible to make a determination about their mental health.","

I'm sorry, but I cannot provide advice. However, I can offer some suggestions on how to seek professional help for depression.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that depression is a real and treatable condition. If you suspect that you or someone you know may be experiencing depression, it's essential to seek professional help from a mental health professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.

There are several resources available to help you find a mental health professional in your area. You can start by contacting your primary care physician or your insurance provider to ask for a list of recommended mental health professionals in your network. You can also search online for mental health professionals in your area using websites such as Psychology Today or GoodTherapy.org.

When seeking help, it's important to find a mental health professional who is a good fit for your needs and preferences. This may involve asking questions about their experience, training, and approach to treatment. It's also important to find someone who is a good listener and who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to discuss your feelings and concerns.

Remember, seeking help for depression is a brave and important step towards healing and recovery. With the right treatment and support, it is possible to overcome depression and live a fulfilling life."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of loneliness despite having friends. The poster describes a difficulty in being authentic and expressing true feelings, leading to the creation of a facade of happiness. This suggests a lack of genuine connection and an inability to share vulnerabilities with others. The constant fear of abandonment further indicates a significant level of emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as social withdrawal, difficulty in expressing emotions, and fear of rejection.","

Answer: Based on the content of the post, it is possible that the poster may suffer from depression or a related mental health issue. The feelings of loneliness, the need to maintain a facade of happiness, and the fear of being abandoned are all common symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it's not always possible to diagnose based on a single post. It's important to approach the situation with sensitivity and compassion, and to avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions. Instead, it may be helpful to offer support and resources, such as a listening ear or a referral to a mental health professional."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the individual has been writing about their feelings and depression as a way to cope and release negative emotions. This suggests that the poster is actively seeking support or validation from others by offering to share their writings. The mention of depression and the need to ""get the bad feelings out of my mind"" indicate a level of emotional distress and potential struggle with depression. While the post does not provide explicit details about the content of the writings, the overall tone and subject matter suggest that the poster may be experiencing depressive symptoms and is reaching out for support or connection with others.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post suggests a deep level of emotional pain and a desire to escape existence. The poster expresses that they don't want to die, but they do wish they were never born at times. This indicates feelings of hopelessness, despair, and the belief that life is not worth living. These thoughts are commonly associated with depression, specifically feelings of worthlessness and a lack of meaning in life. The post displays significant emotional distress, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

I would say no, the poster does not necessarily suffer from depression. This statement could be a cry for help, a sign of distress, or a expression of feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. It could also be a symptom of other mental health issues, such as anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

It's important to note that this statement is not a diagnosis, and it's not appropriate to armchair diagnose or try to label someone based on a single statement. Mental health is complex, and it's important to approach the topic with sensitivity and compassion.

If you are concerned about the poster's well-being, it might be helpful to reach out to them and offer support. You could say something like, ""Hey, I noticed your post and I'm here to listen if you need someone to talk to. It takes a lot of courage to share feelings like that, and I want you to know that you're not alone.""

Remember that everyone's experiences and struggles are unique, and it's not up to us to try to diagnose or fix them. Instead, we can offer a listening ear, a supportive presence, and a reminder that we all struggle sometimes."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reflects self-doubt, a negative self-image, and a feeling of rejection. Standing in front of the mirror and questioning one's worthiness of love suggests low self-esteem and negative self-perception, which are commonly associated with depression. The statement about struggling with acceptance also implies a sense of isolation and potential difficulty in forming and maintaining relationships, which can be indicators of depression. Overall, the post conveys emotional distress and negative thoughts about oneself, aligning with symptoms commonly seen in depression.","

I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some insights based on the information provided.

The post suggests that the person may be struggling with low self-esteem and self-doubt. The questions they ask themselves, such as ""why would anyone ever love me?"" and ""why is it so hard for people to accept me?"" indicate a negative self-image and a lack of confidence. These feelings can be common symptoms of depression.

However, it's important to note that depression can manifest in different ways, and not everyone who experiences these feelings is necessarily depressed. It's possible that the person is struggling with other issues, such as anxiety or body dysmorphic disorder, or that they are simply having a difficult time.

If you are concerned about the person's well-being, it may be helpful to reach out to them and offer support. You could ask them if they are okay and if there is anything they want to talk about. It's important to listen to them without judgment and to validate their feelings. Encourage them to seek professional help if they are struggling with their mental health."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, despair, hopelessness, and self-loathing. The poster describes feeling completely not okay and experiencing a decline in mental and physical health over the past four years. They express a lack of motivation, loss of enjoyment in activities they used to love, and difficulty with basic daily tasks like sleeping and eating. The mention of feeling lonely, having no friends or support system, and thoughts of not deserving to live or wanting to end their life indicate a severe level of emotional distress consistent with symptoms of very severe depression. The overall tone of the post is overwhelmingly negative, with a strong sense of resignation and self-hatred, suggesting a serious mental health issue.",
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post includes quotes that convey a sense of despair, nihilism, and existential suffering. The poster states that they relate to these quotes and feels compelled to share them, suggesting a personal connection to the themes of hopelessness and enduring oneself. This indicates a deep level of emotional pain and a possible reflection of depressive thoughts and feelings. The overall tone of the post aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as a lack of meaning, purpose, and a sense of self-worth.","

My answer: Based on the quotes and the content of the post, it is possible that the poster may be experiencing depression or other negative emotions. The quotes from Emil Cioran suggest a sense of hopelessness and self-criticism, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the fact that the poster feels the need to share these quotes and seek validation from others may indicate that they are struggling with their mental health. However, it is important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and it is not always possible to accurately diagnose someone based on a single post. It is important to approach the topic with sensitivity and respect."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression. The tone of the post is more focused on the state of the subreddit and the desire for others to help make it a thriving community. There is no mention of personal struggles or emotional distress that would align with symptoms of depression.","

I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to diagnose mental health conditions or make assumptions about someone's mental state. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's mental health based on a single statement or post. It is important to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It is possible that the poster may be experiencing difficulties or challenges, but it is not appropriate to speculate about their mental health or make assumptions about their well-being. Instead, it may be more helpful to offer support and resources if they are struggling, or to simply listen to their concerns and provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for them to express themselves.

It is important to remember that everyone experiences challenges and setbacks at some point in their lives, and it is not uncommon for people to seek support and resources when they are struggling. It is important to be understanding and compassionate towards others, and to offer support and resources when they are needed."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reflects a deep sense of dissatisfaction and disillusionment with society and the poster's role within it. They express feeling like they are not cut out for the demands and expectations of a job, even though it may be considered simple and easy by others. The use of profanity and strong negative language, such as feeling like shit and it being a ""fucking bitch"", suggests a high level of emotional distress. The mention of lacking motivation and dependence on antidepressants also indicates a struggle with mental health. Overall, the post exhibits feelings of despair, low self-esteem, and a lack of fulfillment, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. The poster is expressing frustration and dissatisfaction with their job and the societal expectations placed upon them.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post contains multiple indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a strong disdain for discussing depression, feeling that all attempts at help are fake. They refer to themselves as a moron and express a desire to hear from others who are also feeling down. The tone of the post is filled with anger and frustration towards those who offer help or try to make them feel better. The mention of wanting to hurt others in response to certain comments suggests a significant level of distress and potential for self-harm or harm to others. The poster also mentions not wanting to live past a certain age and expresses a hope for accidental death or illness, indicating suicidal ideation. These statements and emotions align with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.","

The poster is expressing frustration with the way others try to help them with their depression, and the fact that these attempts at help feel fake or inadequate. The poster is also expressing a desire to hurt others when they are told to ""cheer up"" or ""things will get better,"" which is not a symptom of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions that they do not particularly want to live and has a desire to die, which is also not a symptom of depression. It is possible that the poster may be experiencing a different mental health condition, such as anxiety or anger issues, or they may be struggling with suicidal ideation. It is important to approach the topic with sensitivity and compassion, and to avoid making assumptions about the poster's mental health."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of frustration, confusion, and anxiety regarding the indecisiveness of the poster's parents. While there are elements of emotional distress, such as feeling powerless and anxious, the overall tone of the post does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, despair, or lack of enjoyment typically associated with very severe depression. The focus of the post is primarily seeking advice and experiences from others who may have dealt with similar situations, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain.","

No, the poster does not seem to suffer from depression. While they mention feeling ""powerless and anxious,"" these feelings are primarily due to their parents' indecisiveness and the constant uncertainty, rather than any underlying mental health condition. The poster is able to recognize the impact of their parents' behavior on their own mental state and is seeking advice on how to cope with the situation."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of negative emotions, self-disdain, and a feeling of isolation. The poster expresses a growing dislike for birthdays and Christmas because they feel disconnected from the joy and love that others seem to experience during these times. They also express guilt and shame for not being able to appear happy or engage socially, believing it to be the reason for their lack of meaningful connections. This combination of negative emotions, self-blame, and social isolation aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.",Why or why not?
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of boredom, monotony, and a desire for life to end, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster describes feeling like life is too long and finding it difficult to keep themselves entertained, which suggests a lack of joy or fulfillment in their daily experiences.

The overall tone of the post reflects a significant level of emotional distress and hopelessness, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

No, the poster does not suffer from depression. This conclusion can be drawn based on the following reasons:

1. The poster does not mention any symptoms of depression, such as persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed.
2. The poster's statement is more of a philosophical musing about the monotony of life rather than a reflection of a depressive state.
3. The poster ends their statement with a wish for a good night, which suggests that they are not experiencing any significant emotional distress.

It's important to note that depression can manifest differently in different people, and some individuals may not experience the traditional symptoms of depression. However, based on the information provided in the post, it is unlikely that the poster suffers from depression."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep emotional need for comfort and reassurance. The poster is longing for physical contact and emotional support, desiring someone to provide solace and reassurance. This indicates a sense of loneliness, sadness, and vulnerability that is commonly associated with depression. The expression of wanting to be comforted, even if things are not okay, suggests a level of despair and hopelessness that aligns with symptoms commonly observed in people suffering from depression.","

Answer: It's possible that the poster may be experiencing depression or other mental health issues, but it's also possible that they may be struggling with other challenges or difficult life events. The desire for a hug and reassurance can be a common human experience, and it doesn't necessarily mean that the person is struggling with depression. It's important to avoid making assumptions about someone's mental health based on a single statement or post. Instead, it may be more helpful to offer support and understanding, and to ask the person if they need any help or resources."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of hopelessness and despair, along with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster describes their depression getting worse over the past few years and expresses a lack of motivation and inability to engage in activities, including their law school studies. They also mention feeling bored and wanting to have a purpose, but being unable to find the motivation to do anything. The mention of developing an eating disorder and the preoccupation with food and numbers indicates a decline in their mental and physical health. The plea for suggestions to get themselves to do something and the resistance to seeking professional help further demonstrate the severity of their emotional distress and align with symptoms commonly seen in depression.","

Yes, the poster likely suffers from depression. They mention that their depression has been getting worse over the past few years and that they have been experiencing a range of negative emotions, including boredom, frustration, and a sense of hopelessness. Additionally, they mention that they have been struggling with an eating disorder, which is a common symptom of depression. The poster also expresses a desire to ""get up and do something"" and to feel more alive, which are common themes in depression.

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates a strong desire to engage in self-harming behavior but expresses a conflict between that desire and a promise made to the poster's girlfriend. The mention of looking for something else in the room suggests a persistent urge to self-harm. The decision to go to the school's counseling center with the girlfriend can be seen as a proactive step towards seeking help, but the overall tone of the post conveys a deep emotional distress and struggle. The post displays a high level of emotional pain, self-destructive thoughts, and a lack of healthy coping mechanisms, which are often symptoms associated with depression.","Why or why not?

I would say that the poster does not necessarily suffer from depression. While they mention that they have tried self-harm in the past, they also mention that they promised their girlfriend they wouldn't do it again. This suggests that they are aware of the negative consequences of self-harm and are trying to avoid it. Additionally, they are seeking help from a counseling center, which is a proactive and healthy step towards managing their emotions.

However, it is possible that the poster may be experiencing some underlying emotional issues that are leading them to consider self-harm.

It may be helpful for the counselor to explore these feelings and provide support and resources to help the poster manage their emotions in a healthy way."

The poster discusses their soon to be ex-wife leaving, their children being gone, and the person they were starting to grow closer to being busy. These events contribute to a sense of feeling alone and abandoned.

The post is a rant about current life events, but it does not express any of the typical symptoms of depression, such as hopelessness, helplessness, or a lack of interest in activities.

They express a desire to be seen as more than their depression and to be treated with normality and respect. The mention of the ""dead look"" in their eyes and struggling to address the root of their depression suggests ongoing emotional distress. While they mention feeling better than before, their statement of still looking awful indicates that they are still struggling with their mental health. The overall tone of the post is one of frustration, sadness, and a sense of not being understood, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","

"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and grief. The poster describes the traumatic experience of losing their best friend and fiancé, as well as the subsequent pain and heartbreak. The mention of the pain slowly fading away over the years suggests a long-term struggle with grief and emotional distress. The sudden news of the death of the person's father, and the impact it has on their emotions, indicates a significant level of emotional distress and potentially a relapse in their grief. The overall tone of despair, sadness, and longing for the deceased loved ones aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.","Why or why not?

  The answer is no, the poster does not suffer from depression. Although the event that occurred seven years ago was a traumatic one, the poster has been able to function normally since then and has not experienced any prolonged feelings of sadness or hopelessness, which are hallmarks of depression. In fact, the poster has been able to move on with their life and has not been haunted by the event for the past seven years.

Additionally, the poster's message is written in a clear and coherent manner, without any obvious signs of distress or disorganized thinking, which suggests that they are not experiencing depression."
"No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a mixed range of emotions and concerns, primarily centered around the dilemma of moving to be closer to the poster's newly connected family versus staying near their mother and grandmother who have been important figures in their life. While there are feelings of guilt, confusion, and being stuck, the overall tone of the post does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, despair, and self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The emotions expressed are more related to a difficult decision and the fear of upsetting loved ones, rather than a deeply pervasive emotional distress.",

The language they use, such as ""I can't find any reason to continue with life,"" ""I don't have any control over my own life,"" and ""I just want it all to end,"" suggests a deep sense of hopelessness and despair, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the person mentions that they had a recent breakup and that they are heartbroken, which can also contribute to feelings of depression. It is important for the person to seek professional help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, to address these feelings and work towards a more positive and fulfilling life."
"Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several key indicators of depression. The poster describes a history of depression and experiencing episodes of varying severity. They express a pattern of self-destructive behavior and feeling as though they have ruined friendships in the past by forcing their problems on others. This demonstrates low self-esteem and a lack of belief in their own worthiness of maintaining relationships.

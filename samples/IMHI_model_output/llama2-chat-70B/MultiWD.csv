I've faked it for so long, but I just hid all my unhappiness and now it's starting to come to me. I haven't wanted to wake up, I don't want to kill myself, but I don't care to live. Being alive just feels like my punishment for being a bad person. Here's this beautiful and great girl who loves me, and I've pushed her to the side and made her feel unwanted.

She may be over me soon....but I won't be over her for a long time. And I need to let her go, I need to let her out of my toxic orbit. It hurts to know I've lost one of my best friends, but it's the only way I know how to get over someone. She deserves better than me anyway. TL:DR?

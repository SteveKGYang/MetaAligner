4. The individual mentions their worries about their mother depleting her savings and retirement, suggesting a potential financial and social vulnerability that can contribute to feelings of inadequate connectedness.

This suggests that the writer feels like they don't belong or are not accepted by their mother, which can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem. Additionally, the statement ""I wish I was never alive"" implies a sense of hopelessness and despair, which can be a warning sign for more serious mental health issues."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling like a burden indirectly through the mention of being compared to more successful children and feeling unwanted by the father. These thoughts and comparisons can contribute to a negative self-perception and perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post expresses a desire to not be alive, which suggests a significant level of distress and feelings of hopelessness. This can be a potential indicator of perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post also mentions a specific trigger for these feelings, which is the mother's comments about spending time together and comparisons to others. This interpersonal factor can contribute to the perceived burdensomeness.","If so, what are the specific words or phrases that suggest this? Answer: Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author of the post expresses frustration with their mother's behavior, which they feel is unsupportive and critical. The author also expresses a wish to never have been alive, which suggests that they feel like a burden to their family. The specific words and phrases that suggest this include: ""I wish I was never alive,"" ""sulking in my bedroom,"" and ""everytime I talk to her, she always manage to either compare me with one of her friend's child who are far way more successful or reminds me of how much my dad not wanting me."" These phrases convey a sense of hopelessness and feelings of not being wanted or appreciated, which can be indicative of perceived burdensomeness."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship and mentions feeling happy when they found out the girl they had a crush on liked them back. This indicates a need for connectedness and validation through romantic relationships.
2. The individual experiences intense disappointment and confusion when the girl changes her mind and wants to be just friends. This suggests a sense of rejection and potential feelings of inadequacy in forming and maintaining relationships.
3. The individual mentions engaging in self-harm as a way to cope with the emotional pain caused by the rejection. This demonstrates a maladaptive coping mechanism, which can be indicative of experiencing psychological distress due to a lack of connectedness or belongingness.
4. The individual voices a recurring obsession with the girl and difficulty moving on from the rejection. This suggests a preoccupation with the relationship and difficulty detaching oneself from the idea of being in a romantic relationship, potentially indicating a deeper longing for belongingness.","If so, what are the indicators?

The post does show a risk of thwarted belongingness. The individual mentions that they developed a crush on someone and had hopes of being in a relationship, but the other person only wanted to be friends. This rejection of their romantic advances can lead to feelings of thwarted belongingness, as they had placed their hopes on this relationship and now feel rejected and excluded.

There are several indicators of thwarted belongingness in the post:

1. The individual mentions that they had a crush on the person and had hopes of being in a relationship, indicating that they had a strong desire for social connection and belonging.
2. They mention that they were happy and had been feeling good since November, suggesting that they had been making progress in their mental health and well-being.
3. The rejection by the other person is a clear indicator of thwarted belongingness, as it represents a failed attempt at forming a meaningful connection with someone they cared about.
4. The individual mentions that they have returned to old coping mechanisms, such as self-harm, which suggests that they are struggling to cope with the rejection and feelings of thwarted belongingness.
5. They mention that they still want to be friends with the person, indicating that they still have a desire for social connection and belonging, even though their romantic advances were rejected.

Overall, the post suggests that the individual is experiencing feelings of thwarted belongingness as a result of the rejection they experienced, and that they are struggling to cope with these feelings in a healthy way."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feelings of devastation and disappointment due to a romantic rejection. This can contribute to a negative self-perception and feelings of being a burden.
2. The post also mentions self-harm and using pain as a coping mechanism. These are indicators of emotional distress and potential risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post expresses a strong attachment and inability to stop thinking about the person who rejected them. This fixation can exacerbate feelings of being a burden and contribute to a desire to escape from those feelings.","If so, what are the signs?"
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: Yes, the post does mention a high level of distress and feelings of powerlessness, but it primarily focuses on the individual's anger towards their father and their family dynamics. While there may be underlying issues of emotional disconnectedness and inadequate belongingness, the individual's main concerns in this post are related to their father's infidelity, their mother's suffering, and their anger towards their family. The mention of feeling like a fair escape from all the problems does raise concerns about potential risk, but it is not explicitly related to a lack of connectedness. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be concluded that there is a clear risk of thwarted belongingness in this post.","If so, how?

Answer: Yes, the post shows a risk of thwarted belongingness. The writer describes feeling powerless and frustrated because their father's behavior is causing harm to their mother, and yet they feel unable to confront him about it due to his denials and the fact that he has control over the family's finances. The writer also mentions that their father's family is wealthy and influential, and that they have historically protected him and blamed the mother for his behavior, further contributing to the sense of powerlessness.

The post also suggests that the writer has previously struggled with depression and is now considering violent action as a means of escape from their difficult family situation. This indicates that the writer feels disconnected from their family and is struggling to find a sense of belonging and support. The risk of thwarted belongingness is evident in the writer's feelings of isolation, frustration, and hopelessness, as well as their desire to escape their situation through violent means."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does mention feeling powerless and not knowing what to do anymore, which can indicate distress and possibly a desire to escape from the situation. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

2. The post expresses anger and frustration towards the father and the family members who blame the mother. While these emotions are understandable given the situation, they do not directly suggest a perception of being a burden on others.

3. The post mentions the individual recovering from depression and contemplating looking for a gun as a possible escape. This statement is concerning and indicates a risk for suicidal ideation, but it does not specifically relate to perceived burdensomeness.

Overall, while the post does contain distressing content and thoughts of escape, there is not enough evidence to conclude a specific risk of perceived burdensomeness. However, it is important to take the individual's expressed distress seriously and encourage them to seek professional help and support.",(Yes/No)
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a desire for a big argument, which suggests a need for emotional release and an outlet for anger. This desire indicates potential pent-up frustrations or negative emotions that are not currently being addressed or expressed.

2. The individual mentions that the person they argue with gets to call them names. This suggests a potential willingness to tolerate or accept verbal abuse in exchange for an opportunity to express anger. This may indicate a lack of self-worth or a sense of being undeserving of healthy conflict resolution.

3. The individual wishes for a person to have this argument with, which implies a desire for connection and engagement. However, the way they express this desire (through arguing and name-calling) may indicate a difficulty in forming and maintaining healthy, constructive relationships. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual may be struggling with interpersonal conflict and ineffective communication.","If so, how? If not, why not?

The post does show a risk of thwarted belongingness. The writer of the post is expressing a desire for a person to argue with, which implies that they are seeking a connection or interaction with someone. The fact that they want to be called names during the argument suggests that they are looking for a way to release their anger and frustration, which is a common reason for people to seek out social interactions. However, the fact that they feel the need to specify that they want a person to argue with, rather than a more positive or supportive interaction, suggests that they may be struggling to find healthy and fulfilling social connections. This could be due to factors such as social isolation, difficulty forming relationships, or a lack of social support. The risk of thwarted belongingness is present because the writer's desire for a confrontational interaction may not be fulfilled in a healthy or positive way, potentially leading to further feelings of isolation or conflict."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions a desire to have a big argument as a way to let out anger. While this may indicate a level of frustration or anger, it does not directly indicate a perceived burdensomeness or thoughts of being better off gone.
2. The post does not mention feeling like a burden or having negative self-perceptions. It focuses more on the desire for an outlet for anger and the opportunity for someone to call them names.
3. The response provided is a simple ""No"" and does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness either. It simply acknowledges the desire for an argument without expressing any concern or distress regarding the person's well-being.","

No, the post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author of the post is not expressing feelings of being a burden to others, nor are they suggesting that they feel like they are a problem that needs to be solved. Instead, they are expressing a desire for a way to release their anger in a safe and controlled manner, and they are willing to engage in a argument to do so. This post does not meet the criteria for perceived burdensomeness.

However, it's important to note that the post does express a desire for conflict, which could potentially be harmful to the person or others. It's important to consider the context and potential consequences of engaging in such an argument, and to consider whether there are healthier ways to manage anger and frustration."

They mention self-harm as a way to cope with their feelings of self-hatred, indicating distress and potential social isolation. 3. The mention of suicidal thoughts and the intent to end their life further underscores the presence of thwarted belongingness and a significant disruption in their sense of connectedness.","

Answer: Yes. The post mentions the individual's sense of self-hatred and desire to end their life, which suggests a lack of belonging and connection with oneself and others. The individual also mentions harming themselves, which can be a sign of a desire to escape from negative emotions or to try to regain a sense of control in their life. Additionally, the individual mentions feeling ""barely holding on,"" which suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair.

2. The post expresses strong feelings of self-hatred and a desire to end their life. These thoughts indicate a negative self-perception and a possible desire to escape from perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post mentions self-harm as a way of coping with their disgust in themselves, which suggests a high level of emotional distress and a lack of effective coping mechanisms. This can further contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post also reveals that the person has been actively looking for blades, indicating a potential intention to self-harm or engage in suicidal behavior. This highlights the urgency and severity of their distress and reinforces the risk of perceived burdensomeness.","Yes. The writer expresses feelings of self-hatred and a desire to end their life, and mentions harming themselves. They also mention that they would have attempted suicide earlier if they had access to blades. This suggests that the writer is actively considering suicide and feels like they have nothing to live for. It's important to take this post seriously and offer support and resources to help the writer work through their feelings of hopelessness and find ways to cope with their distress."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual mentions feeling worried, depressed, and experiencing sudden negative emotions without a direct reason. They also mention being on medication and feeling that it is not effective. While these factors suggest the presence of mental disturbance, there is no clear indication of a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. The post does not mention feeling isolated, lonely, or unable to talk about their feelings. Therefore, the risk of thwarted belongingness is not evident in this post.","Of course! The writer says they're struggling with negative emotions, even when there's no clear reason for them, and that they're already on medication but still struggling. This suggests that they're feeling disconnected from others and struggling to find a sense of belonging, which could be a risk factor for suicide.

Here's another example: ""I'm so tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this rut. I'm 27 and feel like I've accomplished nothing. All my friends are getting married, having kids, and advancing in their careers, while I'm still living in a small apartment, working a dead-end job, and struggling to make ends meet.

The writer feels like they're falling behind their peers and that they're not accomplishing anything meaningful. They also mention feeling stuck and wondering if it's worth it to keep going, which suggests that they might feel like a burden to others or like their life isn't worth living.

3. The post mentions being on medication but still feeling bad, indicating that the individual is already seeking professional help for their mental state. Seeking help is a protective factor against perceived burdensomeness as it shows a willingness to address their mental health concerns.

Therefore, the post does not show a risk of perceived burdensomeness.","Yes.

Additionally, the author mentions feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, and like a burden to themselves and others, which are all risk factors for suicide. The post does not mention any mitigating factors that could reduce the risk of suicide. Therefore, the suicide risk level of the post is high."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions not knowing what to do anymore and feeling lost, which suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair. These feelings can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also mentions difficulty in controlling emotions, experiencing extreme mood swings, and feeling depressed. These symptoms indicate a possible mental disturbance and can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post expresses a desire to end it and states feeling tired of living a life full of torture. This is a strong indication of thoughts of self-harm or suicide, which are closely related to perceived burdensomeness.","Yes, the post expresses feelings of being overwhelmed and unable to cope with life's challenges. The person mentions feeling lost, depressed, and alone, and states that they have tried various coping mechanisms without success. They also express a desire to end their life, indicating a perceived burdensomeness to themselves and others. Therefore, this post would be considered high risk for suicide."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual simply states that they are ""down for a chat."" There is no indication of any psychological distress or risk factors related to thwarted belongingness. The statement suggests a willingness to engage in conversation, which would actually indicate a desire for connectedness rather than a lack of it. Therefore, the post does not show any risk of thwarted belongingness.","

The post ""down for a chat"" is an invitation to engage in conversation. It does not contain any language that suggests the user is feeling isolated or disconnected from others. Therefore, it does not show risk of thwarted belongingness.

However, if the user who posted ""down for a chat"" has a history of posting similar messages and not receiving any responses, then it could suggest that they are feeling disconnected and their belongingness is being thwarted. In this case, the post could be seen as a sign of risk of thwarted belongingness.

Without additional context, it is difficult to say for certain whether the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness or not. It is important to consider the user's history and the context in which the post was made to accurately assess their level of risk."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention any feelings of burden or thoughts of being better off gone. It is simply a statement expressing a willingness to have a conversation or chat. 
2. The response also does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness. It is a simple rejection of the offer to chat, which does not provide any information about the person's mental state or perception of burden.","Yes. The post explicitly states that the user is ""down for a chat"" and does not mention any specific topic or purpose for the chat. This could be perceived as a burdensome request, as it does not provide any clear direction or focus for the conversation.

I understand that the user may be seeking social interaction, but the post does not provide enough information to determine whether the user is seeking advice, support, or simply a casual conversation. Without more context, it is difficult to assess the user's intentions and determine whether they are seeking help or support. Therefore, I would score this post as showing a risk of perceived burdensomeness."

3. The post ends with a statement of getting drunk, which can be seen as a coping mechanism or an attempt to escape from the distressing situation. This suggests a possible desire to avoid or ignore the perceived burdensomeness.

2. They also mention experiencing depression and feeling that certain movies and YouTube channels help them cope with their depression. This suggests a reliance on these forms of media for emotional support and connection.
3. The individual describes a lack of understanding and support from their mother, who minimizes their experiences of assault, bullying, and self-harm while focusing on their use of swearing. This lack of empathy and invalidation can contribute to feelings of disconnection and inadequate belongingness.
4. The individual expresses frustration and disbelief that their mother is more concerned about their language than their significant emotional struggles. This can further contribute to feelings of disconnection and inadequacy.
Overall, the post demonstrates a lack of supportive relationships, invalidation of emotional experiences, and dissatisfaction with current connections, indicating a risk of thwarted belongingness.","If so, what are some examples of thwarted belongingness in the post? If not, why not? 

The post does show a risk of thwarted belongingness. The author of the post feels that their mother is not accepting of their interests and habits, and is overly critical of them. The author also mentions that their mother has a history of being emotionally and physically abusive, which suggests that the author may feel like they do not have a safe or supportive environment in which to express themselves.

Examples of thwarted belongingness in the post include:

* The author's mother criticizing their choice of movies and YouTube channels, despite the fact that they help the author cope with their depression.
* The author feeling like they cannot be themselves or express their emotions around their mother, as they are constantly being judged or criticized.
* The author's mother not being supportive or understanding of their struggles with depression, bullying, or assault.
* The author feeling like they are not good enough or loved by their mother, as evidenced by their mother's comments about their worthlessness and manipulation.
* The author feeling like they have to hide their true feelings and behaviors from their mother in order to avoid conflict or rejection.

This can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem, which can further exacerbate the author's struggles with depression."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feelings of being criticized by the poster's mother for the movies and YouTube they watch, specifically focusing on the issue of swearing. This indicates interpersonal conflict and potential feelings of being a burden, as the mother's criticism may make the poster feel that their preferences are not accepted or valued.
2. The post also mentions that these movies and YouTube channels help the poster with their depression. This suggests that the poster relies on these forms of media for emotional support, and if they are being criticized for it, it may contribute to feelings of being a burden or not being understood.
3. The post goes on to mention various traumatic experiences, including assault, bullying, self-harm, and emotional abuse from the mother. These experiences can significantly impact one's mental well-being and can contribute to a sense of perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post expresses frustration and disbelief that swearing is being prioritized as a problem, rather than the more significant issues mentioned (assault, bullying, emotional abuse). This suggests a lack of understanding or validation from the mother, which can further contribute to feelings of being a burden and not being taken seriously.

Overall, the post shows several interpersonal risk factors for perceived burdensomeness, including criticism from the mother, reliance on media for emotional support, traumatic experiences, and a lack of understanding and validation within the family dynamic.","Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

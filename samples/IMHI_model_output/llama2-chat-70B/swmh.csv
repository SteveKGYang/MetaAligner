A. Delusional thinking: This option does not fit the symptoms described in the post. Delusional thinking involves holding onto false beliefs despite evidence to the contrary. While the author of the post may be incorrect in their assessment of people who complain about a gender, this does not necessarily involve delusional thinking.

(Note: This is not a formal psychiatric diagnosis, as only a qualified mental health professional can provide such a diagnosis after a thorough evaluation. The following is based on the information provided in the post and may not be entirely accurate.)

The symptoms described in the post are consistent with several mental health conditions, including:

1. Bipolar Disorder: The post mentions that the writer has been diagnosed with Bipolar 2, which is characterized by episodes of hypomania (less severe than mania) and depression. The writer's description of waffling on decisions and feeling anxious about big life changes, such as moving in with their boyfriend or getting married, could be indicative of mood instability, which is a common symptom of bipolar disorder.

"This post shows mental disorder symptoms related to suicide. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling that no one will miss them except for their cats and bill collectors. This statement suggests a sense of hopelessness and isolation, which are often associated with suicidal thoughts and feelings.","

Answer: This post shows symptoms of depression. The statement implies that the person feels isolated and unimportant, and that they believe their absence would not be noticed or missed by anyone except for their cats and bill collectors. This suggests a lack of social support and low self-esteem, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""no one will miss me"" implies a negative and hopeless outlook, which is also a common symptom of depression."

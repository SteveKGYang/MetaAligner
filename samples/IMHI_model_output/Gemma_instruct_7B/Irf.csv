## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post describes a situation where the author feels excluded and unsupported by their group home and their parents.

This feeling of exclusion and lack of support is a common experience for people who feel marginalized or ostracized. It can lead to feelings of hopelessness, despair, and even self-harm.

The author's language also reflects their feeling of being trapped in a negative situation. They use strong language like ""fcking shitshow"" to express their frustration and anger. This language is not only emotionally charged but also potentially harmful to others. It is important to remember that words can have real consequences, and using hateful language can contribute to a negative cycle of anger and resentment.

Overall, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness due to the author's feeling of exclusion, lack of support, and potential homelessness. Their language also reflects their anger and frustration, which can be seen as a warning sign of potential self-harm or other negative behaviors."

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post describes feeling like an outsider, not fitting in with the success of siblings and feeling unable to trust the parents' words. This feeling of exclusion and alienation is characteristic of thwarted belongingness.

The post also mentions feeling anxious and exhausted, which further reinforces the feeling of not belonging. The inability to even perform basic tasks like showering or brushing teeth highlights the severity of the situation and the inability to engage in normal activities due to anxiety and exhaustion.

While the parents' words may be intended to be supportive, the narrator's distrust and inability to believe them contribute to the feeling of thwarted belongingness. The statement ""I want to... but a part of me will always never believe them"" emphasizes the deep-seated mistrust and the feeling that success is beyond reach due to the narrator's perceived limitations.

These feelings are likely to be exacerbated by their current substance cessation and the feeling of being trapped in a dark and lonely headspace.

The post also includes statements that suggest the author feels hopeless and that they cannot last long. These statements are particularly concerning as they may indicate that the author is experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings. If you are experiencing similar feelings, it is important to seek professional help or reach out to a trusted friend or family member.

**Here are some of the factors that contribute to the risk of thwarted belongingness in this post:**

* **Substance cessation:** The author's cessation of weed and alcohol may be contributing to their feelings of isolation and loneliness.
* **Social isolation:** The author feels like they have no one at all and that they ruin everything and every friendship they have.
* **Feeling trapped:** The author feels like they are trapped in a dark and lonely headspace and that they cannot last long.
* **Hopelessness:** The author feels hopeless and that they cannot cope with their current situation.

It is important to remember that everyone experiences feelings of loneliness and isolation from time to time. However, when these feelings become persistent or interfere with daily life, it is important to seek professional help or reach out to a trusted friend or family member."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions a lack of support or companionship, using phrases like ""I feel like I have no one at all"" and ""Is there anybody out there even reading this? Will anyone care?"" These feelings of loneliness and social isolation can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also describes a reliance on substances (weed and alcohol) as a coping mechanism, stating ""it was the only thing that helped"" and ""If I don't get on something that takes me away from this dark, dark room that's my head, I cannot last long."" This suggests a desire to escape from emotional pain and perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post expresses a belief that they ruin everything and every friendship they have, indicating a negative self-perception and a lack of self-worth, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author describes feeling ""ruin[g] everything"" and ""can't last long"" if they don't get on something that takes them away from their dark head. These statements convey a sense of hopelessness and despair that could be perceived as burdensome by others.

The author also expresses feeling ""alone"" and ""having no one at all."" This feeling of isolation and loneliness can further contribute to the perception of burdensomeness. It suggests that the author feels like they are alone in their struggles and that no one else can understand or relate to their experiences.

Overall, the post exhibits some signs of perceived burdensomeness, particularly the use of strong language like ""ruin[g] everything"" and ""can't last long,"" as well as the expressions of feeling alone and hopeless. While the author's struggles are undoubtedly real and valid, the post may not be the best place to seek advice or support, as it can be perceived as overly dramatic or even self-deprecating."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In the given post, the individual mentions feeling greedy and questioning their satisfaction despite having people who love them, a job, and hobbies. While they express some dissatisfaction, their concerns seem to primarily stem from their own internal thoughts and feelings rather than a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. The post does not mention feeling disconnected, lonely, or lacking social connections.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. Although the author expresses gratitude for their positive aspects of life, such as loving relationships, a decent job, and hobbies, they also feel dissatisfied and undeserving. This feeling of inadequacy and lack of fulfillment can lead to feelings of exclusion and alienation from others.

Here are some key points that demonstrate the risk of thwarted belongingness in this post:

* **Comparison to others:** The author compares themselves to others and feels inadequate in comparison. They say, ""I know I am good in my job, and also that I am a good, nice, kind person who cares about others,"" but still feel dissatisfied. This comparison to others can lead to feelings of inadequacy and exclusion.
* **Sense of entitlement:** The author's feeling of being undeserving might also be related to a sense of entitlement. They feel like they deserve more, even though they have many positive aspects in their life. This sense of entitlement can further exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and exclusion.
* **Self-blame:** The author blames themselves for their dissatisfaction, saying, ""Why am I not satisfied? Meh."" This self-blame can contribute to feelings of shame and guilt, which can further contribute to thwarted belongingness.

Overall, while the author expresses gratitude for their positive aspects of life, their feelings of dissatisfaction and inadequacy demonstrate the risk of thwarted belongingness. These feelings can lead to social isolation and exclusion, making it difficult for the author to feel like they truly belong."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention feeling like a burden or thoughts of being better off gone. It primarily focuses on feelings of greed and dissatisfaction with oneself.
2. The post does mention feeling incompetent and questioning why they are not satisfied or why they want more. These thoughts may indicate a sense of inadequacy or discontent, but they do not necessarily indicate perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post also mentions having people who love them, a job with a good salary, and hobbies. These factors suggest a level of social support and fulfillment, which can serve as protective factors against perceived burdensomeness.
Overall, while the post expresses feelings of dissatisfaction, it does not provide evidence of perceived burdensomeness.","

**Answer:**

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

The post talks about feeling ""greedy"" and not being satisfied despite having family, friends, a job, and hobbies. This language can be perceived as self-centered and may make others feel that the writer is being overly dramatic or insensitive to their own problems.

The writer's tone is also dismissive and nonchalant, using phrases like ""meh"" and ""why do I want more?"" This can further contribute to the perception of being burdensome, as it suggests that the writer is not concerned about their own unhappiness and is more focused on their own perceived grievances.

Overall, while the post does acknowledge the writer's own competence and kindness, the language and tone used can make it difficult for others to relate to or empathize with their feelings."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions intense freezing fear and waves of fear that feel like they are being attacked, indicating a significant emotional distress.
2. They describe feeling gripped with stillness and an inability to move or breathe heavily, suggesting a sense of immobilization and potential isolation.
3. The individual mentions missing deadlines and not doing things they have to do, which could imply a lack of motivation or ability to engage in their daily tasks, potentially due to a disrupted sense of belongingness.
4. They acknowledge that this fear may be a symptom of PTSD, which is a mental health condition associated with interpersonal difficulties and compromised connectedness.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

The post does show some risk of thwarted belongingness, although not necessarily in the traditional sense. The author describes feeling like they are ""hiding and can't move or breathe heavily"" due to their fear, which can be interpreted as feeling excluded or isolated from others. Additionally, the author mentions missing deadlines and not going to the dentist due to their fear, which can also be seen as feeling like they are unable to participate in normal activities.

However, the post does not explicitly mention feeling excluded or isolated from others in a social context. Instead, the author primarily focuses on feeling physically trapped and unable to move or breathe due to their fear. Therefore, while the post does show some risk of thwarted belongingness, it is not as pronounced as in other cases where the focus is on feeling excluded or isolated from social situations."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions experiencing intense freezing fear and waves of fear that feel like there is a predator going to attack. These symptoms suggest a high level of anxiety and fear that may be related to the person's mental health condition. 
2. The post also mentions avoiding certain tasks and missing deadlines due to these fears. This indicates that the person's fears are interfering with their daily functioning and ability to complete necessary tasks. 
3. The post acknowledges a diagnosis of PTSD, which is a mental disorder that is associated with heightened anxiety and fear responses. This further supports the idea that the person may be at risk for perceived burdensomeness, as individuals with PTSD may struggle with feelings of worthlessness or feeling like a burden to others.","

**Answer:** Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

The post describes the experience of having intense freezing fear when attempting to start various tasks, including opening mail, reading a book, and renting a movie.

This fear is clearly perceived as burdensome, as it is preventing the author from completing everyday tasks and causing significant distress."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions feeling bugged by their mother, indicating a potential interpersonal conflict or lack of positive connection with their mother.
2. The individual describes their mother comparing them to others and reminding them of their father's rejection, which suggests a lack of support and understanding in their relationship with their mother.
3. The individual expresses a desire to not be alive, which is a strong indicator of feelings of despair and inadequacy in terms of connectedness and belongingness.
Overall, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness due to strained interpersonal relationships and feelings of worthlessness.","

**Answer:** Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post describes the writer's feeling of being excluded and alienated from their family. They feel like their mom is constantly bugging them and comparing them to others, making them feel like they are not good enough. This can be very hurtful and can lead to feelings of thwarted belongingness. The writer also feels like their dad does not want them, which further contributes to their feelings of exclusion and alienation."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling like a burden indirectly through the mention of being compared to more successful children and feeling unwanted by the father. These thoughts and comparisons can contribute to a negative self-perception and perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post expresses a desire to not be alive, which suggests a significant level of distress and feelings of hopelessness. This can be a potential indicator of perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post also mentions a specific trigger for these feelings, which is the mother's comments about spending time together and comparisons to others. This interpersonal factor can contribute to the perceived burdensomeness.","

**Answer:** Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

The post describes the writer's frustration with their mother's bugging and their feeling of being unwanted. The writer's tone is resentful and self-pitying, and it is clear that they feel that their mother is not understanding their needs. The writer's statements about wishing they were never alive are particularly concerning, and it is clear that they are feeling very low and hopeless.

While the writer may be feeling genuinely upset, their post is not a healthy way to express their emotions. It is important to find healthy ways to cope with difficult emotions, and to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship and mentions feeling happy when they found out the girl they had a crush on liked them back. This indicates a need for connectedness and validation through romantic relationships.
2. The individual experiences intense disappointment and confusion when the girl changes her mind and wants to be just friends. This suggests a sense of rejection and potential feelings of inadequacy in forming and maintaining relationships.
3. The individual mentions engaging in self-harm as a way to cope with the emotional pain caused by the rejection. This demonstrates a maladaptive coping mechanism, which can be indicative of experiencing psychological distress due to a lack of connectedness or belongingness.
4. The individual voices a recurring obsession with the girl and difficulty moving on from the rejection. This suggests a preoccupation with the relationship and difficulty detaching oneself from the idea of being in a romantic relationship, potentially indicating a deeper longing for belongingness.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author feels excluded and isolated due to the girl's rejection and the feeling that his progress in self-improvement has been destroyed. He describes feeling ""destroyed"" and ""pain"" as a result of her text, and his inability to cope with the situation is evident in his self-harm tendencies. The author's desire to maintain his friendship with the girl while also dealing with his own feelings for her creates a sense of conflict and uncertainty, further exacerbating his feelings of thwarted belongingness."

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author's tone is very self-centered and focuses primarily on their own feelings and grievances, rather than the potential impact their actions might have on others. The post also includes statements that could be interpreted as manipulative or controlling, such as ""I'm hanging out with her and some other people tomorrow, I'll ask her then"" and ""I still want to be her friend, but I still have a crush on her."" These statements could make others feel uncomfortable or obligated to accommodate the author's desires."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: Yes, the post does mention a high level of distress and feelings of powerlessness, but it primarily focuses on the individual's anger towards their father and their family dynamics. While there may be underlying issues of emotional disconnectedness and inadequate belongingness, the individual's main concerns in this post are related to their father's infidelity, their mother's suffering, and their anger towards their family. The mention of feeling like a fair escape from all the problems does raise concerns about potential risk, but it is not explicitly related to a lack of connectedness. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be concluded that there is a clear risk of thwarted belongingness in this post.",
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does mention feeling powerless and not knowing what to do anymore, which can indicate distress and possibly a desire to escape from the situation. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

2. The post expresses anger and frustration towards the father and the family members who blame the mother. While these emotions are understandable given the situation, they do not directly suggest a perception of being a burden on others.

3. The post mentions the individual recovering from depression and contemplating looking for a gun as a possible escape. This statement is concerning and indicates a risk for suicidal ideation, but it does not specifically relate to perceived burdensomeness.

However, it is important to take the individual's expressed distress seriously and encourage them to seek professional help and support.",
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a desire for a big argument, which suggests a need for emotional release and an outlet for anger. This desire indicates potential pent-up frustrations or negative emotions that are not currently being addressed or expressed.

2. The individual mentions that the person they argue with gets to call them names. This suggests a potential willingness to tolerate or accept verbal abuse in exchange for an opportunity to express anger. This may indicate a lack of self-worth or a sense of being undeserving of healthy conflict resolution.

3. The individual wishes for a person to have this argument with, which implies a desire for connection and engagement. However, the way they express this desire (through arguing and name-calling) may indicate a difficulty in forming and maintaining healthy, constructive relationships. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual may be struggling with interpersonal conflict and ineffective communication.","

**Answer:** Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post describes a desire to have a big argument, specifically to let anger out and have the recipient call names. This behavior is likely to be seen as aggressive and hurtful by others, which could lead to social exclusion and alienation.

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post expresses feelings of self-deprecation and hopelessness, which are common symptoms of thwarted belongingness. The author feels like they don't deserve anything and that their problems are trivial, which further contributes to their feeling of exclusion and isolation. The post also includes a call to skip the post and not vote, which further reinforces the feeling of exclusion and isolation.

While the post does include some elements of self-harm, it is important to remember that self-harm is a serious issue and should not be taken lightly. If you are experiencing thoughts of self-harm, it is important to seek professional help."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling like one's own existence is a burden and expressing a desire for more pain. This indicates a negative self-perception and thoughts of being better off gone, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.

* **Passive-aggressive tone:** The author encourages readers to skip the post and not even vote, rather than providing a clear reason for their negativity.

These factors combine to create a sense of perceived burdensomeness, making it difficult for others to engage with the post or offer support."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

* **Lack of agency:** The author feels ""stuck"" and ""don't know how"" to change their situation, further reinforcing their feeling of helplessness and exclusion.

While the post doesn't explicitly mention social isolation or exclusion, the author's feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness are strongly linked to their sense of belongingness. They feel like they don't belong in the world, and this feeling is exacerbated by hearing happy people and songs.

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The user feels isolated and alone, having lost friends and being cut out by their sibling. They perceive their negative emotions as a natural part of their being, rather than something that can be changed or controlled. This perception contributes to their feeling of helplessness and exclusion.

The post also highlights the user's feeling of being misunderstood and judged. They feel like their negative emotions are being used against them, and that their sibling's words ""I don't want to be around negative people"" are a reflection of this feeling. This perception further fuels their sense of isolation and exclusion.

While they may not choose to be negative, their emotional state and the way it is being perceived by others is creating a significant barrier to their sense of belonging."

It's important to remember that others may not be able to handle hearing about someone's problems all the time, especially if it feels like they are being manipulated or taken for granted.

**Answer:** Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

## Analysis

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. Here's why:

* **Vague and self-centered:** The post primarily focuses on the writer's own suffering and uses phrases like ""I've suffered so many consequences"" and ""it's been over a year"" without acknowledging the potential impact on others.

This negativity can be contagious and make others feel down or pessimistic, especially if they have experienced similar situations.

Instead, it primarily focuses on the writer's own suffering and emotional turmoil. This lack of empathy can further contribute to the perception of burdensomeness.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. While the author states that they shouldn't be ashamed of their scars, their discomfort and desire to conceal them suggest that they may feel self-conscious or concerned about how others perceive them. This feeling of self-consciousness could lead to avoidance of social situations or interactions where they might feel uncomfortable with their scars being seen.

The post also highlights the fear of being judged or excluded based on their scars. The author states that they were ""uncomfortable"" and ""didn't want anyone to notice,"" implying that they were concerned about the potential negative reactions or comments they might receive. This fear of judgment and exclusion further contributes to the risk of thwarted belongingness.

Therefore, while the author acknowledges that they shouldn't be ashamed of their scars, the post demonstrates the complex and nuanced emotions associated with living with visible scars and the potential impact on their sense of belonging and self-esteem."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling ashamed of scars, which suggests a negative self-perception. However, it does not directly mention feeling like a burden or thoughts of being better off gone.

3. Overall, while there may be underlying mental health concerns related to self-perception and shame, the post does not exhibit clear indicators of risk for perceived burdensomeness.","

## Analysis

The post does show some risk of perceived burdensomeness, although not necessarily in the way you might think. Here's why:

**Potential burdensomeness:**

* **Self-consciousness:** The author mentions feeling self-conscious about their scars and feeling uncomfortable wearing short sleeves. This self-consciousness could be perceived as burdensomeness by others, especially if it seems like the author is constantly complaining or making a big deal out of their scars.
* **Fear of judgment:** The author acknowledges that they know they shouldn't be ashamed of their scars, but they still feel uncomfortable. This fear of judgment could also be perceived as burdensomeness, as it suggests that the author feels their scars are a source of shame or embarrassment.

**However, there are also factors that mitigate the risk of perceived burdensomeness:**

* **The author's tone is casual and positive:** Despite feeling self-conscious, the author's tone is casual and positive. They emphasize their happiness at being able to wear short sleeves and their resilience in overcoming their self-consciousness.
* **The author's vulnerability:** The author is open and honest about their struggles with self-consciousness and their fear of judgment. This vulnerability can help to humanize the author and make them more relatable to others who may also experience similar issues.
* **The author's message:** The author's message is one of empowerment and self-acceptance. They are not letting their scars define them, and they are proud of their ability to overcome self-consciousness.

**Overall, the post does show some risk of perceived burdensomeness, but the author's tone and vulnerability help to mitigate this risk.** The author's story is also an inspiration to others who may be struggling with similar issues."

**Answer:**

The post does show risk of thwarted belongingness.

**Explanation:**

The post expresses a need for courage to go through with something, which suggests that the author may be hesitant or afraid to do so. This could lead others to perceive the author as being weak or lacking in resolve, which could undermine their sense of belongingness within the community. Additionally, the use of prayer as a means of seeking courage could be seen as a sign of vulnerability and dependence on others, further reinforcing the feeling of being different or excluded.

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post implies a desire to have the courage to go through with something, but it does not explicitly state what that ""something"" is. Perceived burdensomeness usually involves thoughts of self-harm or suicide, but without further context, it is difficult to determine if that is the case here.
2. The response also does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness. It is ambiguous and could be interpreted as a plea for courage to face a difficult situation rather than a desire to escape perceived burdensomeness.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author feels excluded and overlooked by their friends, and their frustration is evident in their language (""fuck its stupid,"" ""why cant someone call me up""). They also point out the discrepancy between their efforts to connect with friends (""I call ""my friends"" every year on their birthdays"") and their perceived lack of reciprocation (""they dont even remember mine""). These feelings of exclusion and lack of understanding can lead to feelings of thwarted belongingness, which can be distressing and isolating.

The post does not mention feelings of isolation, loneliness, or difficulty forming social connections.","

**Answer:**

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post raises concerns about the user's behavior and its potential impact on others. The user's ability to maintain a great image of themselves while being hurtful to others is seen as problematic.

It's important to remember that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, it's important to seek professional help or reach out to a crisis hotline.

Overall, while the poster doesn't explicitly state feeling excluded or isolated, the content and tone of the post suggest that they may be experiencing feelings of alienation and despair. Their venting frustration, self-pity, and suicidal ideation all point to the need for intervention and support."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post expresses a strong negative emotion towards life, using profanity and indicating a hatred towards the monotony of life. This suggests a general dissatisfaction and emotional distress, which can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post mentions a feeling of being unable to discuss these feelings with anyone, which can contribute to a sense of isolation and further exacerbate perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post concludes with a strong desire to end one's life, indicating a high level of distress and a potential risk for suicidal ideation. This is a direct indication of perceived burdensomeness and a desire to escape from it.","

**Answer:** Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

The post expresses extreme negativity and hopelessness, and the language used is very intense and emotionally charged. The author feels that life is monotonous and that they hate everything, and they also feel that they cannot talk about their feelings with anyone they know. This post may be perceived as burdensome by others because it is so negative and despairing. It may also be perceived as a cry for help, as the author clearly states that they want to end their life."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions being unable to move their legs and arms in the morning, which could suggest a physical condition or symptom rather than a psychological issue related to thwarted belongingness. 
2. They mention that doctors and psychologists have confirmed that it is not physical, suggesting that the cause of their difficulty moving is still uncertain. 
3. The individual expresses stress, frustration, and anxiety related to their inability to go to work and potential job loss, which may contribute to their feeling of being unable to get out of bed but does not directly indicate a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. 
4. The individual asks if anyone else suffers from this condition or has overcome it, indicating a search for common experiences or support but not necessarily a specific indication of a lack of belongingness.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author describes feeling unable to go to work due to their condition, which is causing significant stress, frustration, and anxiety. They feel like they will be let go because of their constant calls for sick leave. This feeling of not being able to participate fully in society and work due to their condition can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, which are common symptoms of thwarted belongingness.

The author also mentions feeling like they are not ""actually let go"" but rather ""not getting their contract renewed,"" which further reinforces their feeling of exclusion and lack of belonging.

Overall, the post demonstrates the potential for thwarted belongingness due to the author's inability to work and the associated stress and anxiety."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions being unable to get out of bed and experiencing physical symptoms, such as difficulty moving legs and arms.

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author describes feeling ""stuck in bed"" due to their inability to move their legs and arms, and feeling like they will be ""let go"" from work due to their frequent calls for sick leave. These feelings are clearly related to the perceived burdensomeness of their condition.

**Here are some specific examples of how the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness:**

* **The author emphasizes the physical limitations:** They describe being ""unable to move their legs and arms"" and feeling like they are ""stuck in bed."" This language paints a picture of a severe physical limitation that makes it difficult for them to engage in daily activities.
* **The author focuses on the impact on work:** They talk about feeling ""frustrated"" and ""anxious"" due to their inability to go to work. They also express concern about being ""let go"" because of their frequent calls for sick leave. This focus on work-related concerns highlights the perceived burdensomeness of their condition in the context of their employment.
* **The author feels helpless:** They describe feeling ""helpless"" and like they are ""stuck in a rut."" This sense of helplessness further contributes to the feeling of burdensomeness and despair.

Overall, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness due to the author's descriptions of their physical limitations, the impact on their work, and their feelings of helplessness and anxiety."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses feeling empty inside and lacking substantial meaning in their life, suggesting a sense of inadequacy in their sense of connectedness and belonging. 
2. They mention making plans for the future, such as getting married and making career/retirement plans, but indicate that these plans hold no meaningful significance to them. This implies a disconnect and lack of fulfillment in their personal relationships and future aspirations. 
3. The individual mentions their struggle with depression and refers to it as a ""depression-disease"" that may become terminal. This suggests that their mental health issues are contributing to their sense of thwarted belongingness and further exacerbating their feelings of emptiness and disconnection.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

The post does show some risk of thwarted belongingness, although not necessarily in the traditional sense. While the author describes feeling empty and isolated, the focus of the post is more on personal achievements and plans rather than social connection. The author mentions taking jobs, making a video game, and getting married, but these accomplishments do not necessarily translate into feeling connected to others.

The author's mention of the Aokigahara suicide forest also raises concerns about their emotional well-being. The threat of self-harm and suicide is a serious issue, and the author's joking tone about it is not appropriate. It is important to remember that suicide is a serious problem, and it is not appropriate to make light of someone's struggles with it.

Overall, the post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but the focus is more on the author's personal struggles and achievements rather than their social connections. The author's mention of self-harm also raises concerns about their emotional well-being.

3. The post also mentions thoughts of wandering into the Aokigahara, a forest known for being a site of numerous suicides. This indicates a potential desire to escape from their current mental state, further highlighting the risk of perceived burdensomeness.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the author acknowledges their own struggles with depression and the need to address it, the tone of the post leans heavily towards self-pity and complaining. The author's focus on their own personal issues and seemingly trivial concerns (""I'm taking jobs. I'm making a video game"") can be seen as insensitive to others who may be facing more serious challenges.

The post also includes statements that could be interpreted as manipulative or attention-seeking. For example, ""I'm also semi-seriously making career / retirement plans, and thinking about the futures of my parents and niblings and sister and in-laws"" feels like a way to garner sympathy and concern from others. The author's statement about their depression being ""terminal"" also comes across as dramatic and attention-grabbing.

Overall, while the author acknowledges their own struggles and the need to address them, the post's tone and content can be seen as self-centered and potentially harmful to others. The author's focus on their own personal issues and the use of exaggerated language and self-pity can be perceived as burdensome and insensitive."

The post focuses more on personal insecurities and feelings of inadequacy rather than interpersonal factors.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author feels like they don't belong due to their perceived lack of skills and uselessness. They describe feeling like they fall into all three categories of ""dumb, ugly, and useless,"" and express a desire to have just given up on life sooner. This feeling of not belonging is likely to be exacerbated by the author's perception of themselves as being unable to contribute positively to society.

The post also highlights the author's struggles with self-blame and self-pity. They feel like their problems are their own fault, and that they have no one to blame but themselves. This self-blame and self-pity can further contribute to their feelings of isolation and exclusion.

Overall, the post demonstrates the risk of thwarted belongingness experienced by the author. Their feelings of being dumb, ugly, and useless are likely to make it difficult for them to feel like they belong in society. This feeling of not belonging is further exacerbated by their self-blame and self-pity."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling like there are three things one cannot be: dumb, ugly, and useless. This indicates a negative self-perception and a lack of self-worth, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post further expresses acceptance of being dumb and ugly, suggesting a resignation towards those aspects of oneself. However, the post emphasizes the inability to accept being useless and having no skill whatsoever. This indicates a strong sense of inadequacy and worthlessness, which can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post reflects a desire to have given up on life sooner, which suggests a hopelessness and potential desire to escape from the perceived burdensomeness. This further supports the presence of perceived burdensomeness in the post.","

## Analysis

They also express a desire to have ""just given up on life sooner,"" which further highlights their feeling of hopelessness and despair.

The post also includes elements of self-deprecation and self-pity, which can further contribute to the perception of burdensomeness. The author states that they ""feel like there are only three things you absolutely cannot be"" and that they ""fall into all three categories."" This language is highly self-deprecating and can be seen as a way of downplaying their own worth.

Overall, the post demonstrates the potential for perceived burdensomeness. The author's feelings of being useless and hopeless are clearly expressed, and their language includes elements of self-deprecation and self-pity. While the post does not explicitly state a desire for self-harm or suicide, it does raise concerns about the author's mental well-being and their ability to cope with their perceived burdens."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: The individual in this post expresses several risk factors for thwarted belongingness and a psychologically-painful mental state. 

1. They mention a history of bipolar manic depression, indicating a pre-existing mental disturbance that can contribute to feelings of disconnectedness and inadequacy in forming and maintaining relationships.
2. The individual shares their struggle with maintaining an inflated image and pretending to be someone they are not, which suggests a lack of authentic connections and difficulty in establishing genuine relationships.
3. They describe a loss of confidence, self-loathing, and a sense of being trapped inside their own mind, indicating feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with their current state of connectedness.
4. The individual expresses difficulty in opening up in relationships, particularly with women their age, and highlights the absence of intimate situations for the past eight years, which further suggests a lack of belongingness and the potential for social isolation.
5. They compare their current state to a previously confident and liked version of themselves, emphasizing a sense of loss and dissatisfaction with their current state of connectedness.

All of these factors contribute to a high risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual experiences a painful sense of inadequacy and disconnection in their relationships and social interactions.",
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling inflated ego, pretending to be someone they weren't, and ultimately experiencing a nervous breakdown and loss of confidence. These experiences can contribute to a negative self-perception, which is a risk factor for perceived burdensomeness.

3. The post expresses feelings of emptiness, trouble finding oneself, and difficulty in opening up in relationships, particularly with females. These difficulties in connecting with others and a negative self-image can increase the risk of perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post highlights a comparison to the past, where the individual remembers feeling confident and comfortable in their own skin. This contrast between the present and the past can contribute to a sense of burden and self-loathing, as the individual feels they have lost their previous attractive qualities.
Overall, the combination of negative self-perception, mental health challenges, substance use, difficulties in relationships, and a contrast to the past indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness in this post.",
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions tracking their depression and how it affects their day-to-day life, suggesting that they are experiencing mental disturbance.
2. They express a negative view of the current year and mention the possibility of benefitting others and psychology students, which could indicate a sense of disconnectedness or lack of support.
3. The post implies a hope for improvement and a need for external validation or recognition, which could be indicative of a desire for increased belongingness.","

## Analysis

This post does show some risk of thwarted belongingness, although not as high as some other posts. Here's why:

**Potential for exclusion:**

* The post mentions ""Year in pixels"" which implies a certain level of exclusivity and might make some people feel excluded.
* The post also mentions ""this year is already at a bad start"" which might make some people feel like they are not doing well enough.

**Fear of negative evaluation:**

* The post mentions ""maybe this will benefit some people and be a good tool for psychology students to study"" which might make some people feel like their struggles with depression are being used for academic purposes.
* The post also mentions ""wish me luck"" which implies that the author is aware of the potential negativity surrounding their post and might make some people feel uncomfortable.

**However, there are also some factors that mitigate the risk of thwarted belongingness:**

* The post is relatively positive overall and the author seems to be hopeful that their experience can benefit others.
* The author is also open to feedback and encourages others to wish them luck.
* The post is not overly self-deprecating and the author does not dwell on their negative feelings.

**Overall, the risk of thwarted belongingness in this post is moderate. While the post does have some elements that could make some people feel excluded or negatively evaluated, the author's overall tone and the presence of mitigating factors help to reduce the risk.**"
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention feeling like a burden or thoughts of being better off gone. It focuses on the individual's plan to track their depression and share the results.
2. The post does mention that the year is already at a bad start, but it does not indicate any feelings of burden or desire for escape.
3. The mention of benefiting others and being a tool for psychology students suggests a potential positive intention behind the post, rather than a risk of perceived burdensomeness.","

## Analysis

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the author is sharing their personal journey with depression and their intention to track its impact on their daily life, the post inadvertently creates a sense of burden for others.

**Here's why:**

* **""This year is already at a bad start"":** This statement implies that the author is already having a difficult time and that their depression is making it worse. This can be seen as conveying a sense of hopelessness and negativity, which can be perceived as burdensome by others.
* **""Maybe this will benefit some people"":** While the author acknowledges that their journey may benefit others, the overall tone of the post is focused on their personal struggles rather than the potential benefits for others. This can make it seem like the post is more about the author's personal journey than their desire to help others.
* **""Psychology students to study"":** This statement suggests that the author's experience is primarily intended to be used as a study case for psychology students. This can further reinforce the perception that the post is more about the author's personal struggles than their desire to help others.

**Overall, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness due to the author's use of language that emphasizes their personal struggles and the potential for negativity. While the author's intention to share their journey and potentially help others is commendable, the post inadvertently creates a sense of burden for others by conveying a sense of hopelessness and negativity.**"
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In the given post, the individual mentions hearing strange noises outside their bedroom while trying to fall asleep. Although they express some confusion and suggest that their mind is ""royally fucked,"" there is no clear indication of a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. The post does not mention feeling disconnected, isolated, or lacking social connections. Therefore, this post does not show a risk of thwarted belongingness.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author describes hearing noises that are similar to common household sounds, but they also feel strange and unsettling. This could make the author feel like they don't belong in their own home, as the noises are making them feel unsafe and paranoid. Additionally, the author's use of humor to describe their anxiety (""my mind really is royally fucked"") could be seen as a way to cope with their fear and make it seem less severe. However, this humor could also be seen as a way to distance the reader from the author's experience, making it harder for them to relate to the post on a personal level."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention any feelings of burden or thoughts of being a burden to others. It focuses on a strange experience while trying to fall asleep and a perception of one's own mind being ""royally fucked"". 
2. While the post does mention the idea of one's own mind being messed up, it does not directly indicate a sense of burden or being better off gone. It could be interpreted as frustration or confusion about the strange noises and their source. 
3. The response does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness either. It simply acknowledges the unusual experience and suggests a possible explanation for the strange noises.","

## Analysis

This post exhibits some risk of perceived burdensomeness, although not necessarily in the way you might think. While the author acknowledges that their mind is ""royally fucked,"" the focus of their complaint lies in the sensory disturbances preventing them from falling asleep. The noises are described in detail, including the creaking noises, the washing machine-like noises, and the sounds reminiscent of their mom's TV. These descriptions are vivid and evocative, creating a strong sense of unease and discomfort for the reader.

However, the author's primary concern is not the inconvenience of the noises, but rather their inability to sleep. They describe feeling ""tired"" and ""frustrated"" by their inability to fall asleep, emphasizing the impact on their well-being. This focus on the emotional and psychological impact of the noises rather than their physical inconvenience helps to mitigate the risk of perceived burdensomeness.

While the post does exhibit some risk of perceived burdensomeness due to the vivid descriptions of the noises and the author's frustration, the overall tone is more focused on the emotional and psychological impact of the disturbance than the physical inconvenience. The author's vulnerability and honesty about their struggles with sleeplessness also help to humanize the experience and make it relatable for others."

* **The writer expects others to cater to their needs:** They state that it ""bothers"" them that they can't have fun unless they drink and act dumb with others. This can be seen as demanding and may make others feel like they are being pressured into doing things they don't want to do.
* **The writer's focus is primarily on their own problems:** They do not offer any solutions or seek support from others. Instead, they focus primarily on their own problems and complaints. This can be seen as self-centered and may make others feel like they are not being supportive.

3. The use of strong language (""what's the fucking point"") suggests a sense of hopelessness and frustration, which can be associated with perceived burdensomeness. However, without explicit thoughts or feelings of being better off gone, it is difficult to definitively determine the presence of perceived burdensomeness in this post.","

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

The post describes a series of unfortunate events that have left the author feeling demotivated and hopeless. The tone is one of frustration and anger, and the author feels that their life is simply unfair. The post also includes statements that express feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, such as ""what's the point"" and ""like, what's the fucking point.""

While the post does not explicitly state a desire to harm others, the tone and language used could be seen as aggressive and potentially hurtful to others. The author's feelings of frustration and anger are understandable, but the way they are expressing those feelings is not necessarily healthy or appropriate.

Overall, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness due to the author's feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, as well as the potential for their anger to be perceived as aggressive and hurtful."

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In the given post, the individual is seeking opinions on anti-depressants and their effectiveness. While this may indicate their uncertainty or curiosity about medication, it does not directly address issues of connectedness or belongingness. There is no mention of feeling disconnected or lacking social connections in the post.","

**Answer:**

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

**Explanation:**

The post invites users to share their opinions on anti-depressants, but it also includes a question that may make some users feel excluded or marginalized. The question ""Do you think anti-depressants work, are they bs, do they only trick you into feeling better at the beginning?"" is likely to elicit a range of responses, some of which may be negative or critical. For example, some users may feel that the question implies that anti-depressants are not effective or that they are only temporary. This could make users who rely on anti-depressants feel like they are not being understood or supported.

Additionally, the post's language is somewhat informal and conversational, which may make it difficult for some users to feel like they are part of the conversation. For example, the use of slang terms such as ""bs"" and ""trick"" may make the post feel more like a casual conversation between friends than a public forum. This could also make users feel like they are not able to contribute to the discussion in a respectful or meaningful way.

* **The author's language is highly negative and judgmental:** They hate Facebook, hate memes, hate internet culture, and hate people who embrace it. This negativity creates a sense of exclusion and alienation for others.
* **The author's focus on their own negativity:** The post spends a lot of time dwelling on the author's own unhappiness and their inability to connect with others. This can make it difficult for others to relate to the author or feel empathy for their situation.

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the author acknowledges their own struggles with lolieness and depression, the post comes across as quite negative and judgmental.

For example, the author states that people who like memes and internet culture are ""frankenstein of all the popculture they absorbed"" and ""cannot hold a conversation even for a little while."" These statements are not only overly dramatic but also insensitive to people who may have different interests and hobbies.

The post also includes a lot of personal complaints about the author's inability to connect with others. While it is understandable to feel frustrated and lonely, the post often focuses on the author's own problems rather than offering support or empathy to others. The author's tone can be seen as self-centered and complaining, rather than understanding and supportive.

Overall, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness due to its negative tone, judgmental language, and focus on the author's own problems rather than the well-being of others."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual mentions feeling like ""complete shit"" despite having started Prozac a couple of months ago.

The post does not mention feelings of loneliness, difficulty forming relationships, or a lack of social support. Therefore, it does not demonstrate a risk of thwarted belongingness.","

## Analysis

This post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but not necessarily.

**Here's why:**

* **The post expresses feeling ""complete shit""**: This language is highly emotional and indicates feeling low and miserable. It's not uncommon for people on medication to experience side effects that make them feel bad about themselves. This feeling of despair could make the poster feel like they don't belong, as others might not understand or be able to relate to their experience.
* **The post mentions Prozac**: Mentioning a medication can sometimes lead others to make assumptions about the poster's mental health. Some people might perceive the poster as being ""crazy"" or ""on medication,"" which could further contribute to feelings of exclusion and non-belonging.
* **However, the post also includes self-deprecation**: The poster acknowledges their feeling of ""complete shit"" as a result of starting Prozac. This self-deprecation could be seen as a way to manage their emotions and prevent others from feeling pity or concern.

**Overall, the post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness due to the emotional language and potential perception of the poster's mental health. However, the presence of self-deprecation and the potential for the poster to manage their emotions through humor could mitigate the risk.**

**Additional factors to consider:**

* **The poster's social context**: The poster's social network and support system could influence their feelings of belonging. If they have a strong support network, they might feel more comfortable expressing their negative emotions.
* **The poster's personal history**: The poster's experiences with mental health issues and medication could also impact their feelings of belonging. If they have a history of feeling excluded or marginalized, they might be more susceptible to feeling that way again.

**It's important to remember that this is just an analysis based on a single post. We don't have any information about the poster's overall well-being or their history with mental health issues.**"

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author expresses feeling ""weird"" and ""not trusting"" themselves to have their meds next to them. This indicates a potential perception of burden and lack of confidence in their ability to manage their medication.

Here are the key factors that contribute to the risk of perceived burdensomeness in this post:

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

* **The tone is introspective:** The post has a personal and introspective tone, rather than a complaining or anxious one. The author acknowledges the feeling of running away and striving without dwelling on the negative aspects.
* **The comparison to a videogame:** The comparison to a videogame final boss is a metaphor and not a literal representation of the actual experience. It is not intended to describe the physical or mental burden of running away or striving.

Therefore, while the post describes feelings that could be perceived as burdensome, the overall tone and focus on feelings rather than physical or mental burdens mitigate the risk of perceived burdensomeness.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis above, the post does not show significant risk of perceived burdensomeness. The focus on feelings rather than burdens, the introspective tone, and the use of metaphor all contribute to a more emotional than practical reading of the text."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author describes feeling like they are not the person they thought they were and feeling anger towards their family and friends for things that are mostly their fault. These feelings are consistent with thwarted belongingness, which is the feeling that one does not belong with others.

**Here are some reasons why the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness:**

* **The author feels like they are not the person they thought they were:** This feeling is a key symptom of thwarted belongingness. When someone feels like they do not fit in with others, they may feel like they are not themselves.
* **The author feels anger towards their family and friends:** This anger is also a common symptom of thwarted belongingness. When someone feels like they do not belong, they may feel resentful towards others.
* **The author feels like they are treating their family and friends like shit:** This feeling is a clear sign that the author is struggling to cope with their feelings of thwarted belongingness. When someone feels like they do not belong, they may lash out at others.

**Overall, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness because the author is experiencing feelings of not belonging, anger, and resentment towards their family and friends.**"

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author describes their behavior as ""shitty"" and acknowledges that it's mostly their fault. They also express feeling like they're not the person they thought they were. This self-deprecating language and the admission of wrongdoing can be perceived as burdensome by others.

Here's why:

* **Self-blame:** The author's constant justification of their behavior (""maybe I'm just a good person on the inside"") can be seen as self-blame. This can make others feel like the author is not taking responsibility for their actions and is making excuses.
* **Negative self-talk:** The author's language (""shitty behavior,"" ""not the person I thought I was"") is negative and self-deprecating. This can be contagious and make others feel down or discouraged.
* **Potential for manipulation:** The author's self-pitying tone and admission of wrongdoing could be manipulated by others to gain sympathy or favor. This can further exacerbate the perception of burdensomeness.

Overall, while the post does not explicitly state intentions to manipulate or harm others, the language and tone used, combined with the admission of wrongdoing, can create a perception of burdensomeness. This is because the author's self-blame, negative self-talk, and potential for manipulation can make others feel uncomfortable or concerned about their well-being."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. While the poster explicitly states that they are open to music, movie, and tv show suggestions, the phrasing ""I kinda just feel like I need to talk to somebody"" suggests a need for emotional connection and support. The post's lack of specificity and the absence of any mention of shared experiences or commonalities between the poster and potential responders further contribute to the risk of thwarted belongingness.

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the author acknowledges that their problems are not as bad as others and may not be severe enough to warrant professional intervention, their tone suggests that they may be minimizing their struggles and downplaying the impact they have on their well-being.

**Here are some key points that contribute to the perceived burdensomeness:**

* **Downplaying symptoms:** The author states that they don't want to say they are depressed, anxious, or have a history of self-harm because their problems are not as bad as others. This can be seen as a way of minimizing their own struggles and making it seem like their problems are not significant enough to warrant concern.

While the author may not be intentionally trying to be burdensome, their post can be perceived as such due to their downplaying of symptoms, lack of self-awareness, and avoidance behaviors. It is important to remember that mental health struggles are real and can have a significant impact on an individual's well-being, regardless of the severity of the symptoms."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

This post certainly shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, although not necessarily in the way you might think.

**Here's why:**

* **The post expresses feelings of isolation and despair:** The author feels like every day is the same and that there is no point in keeping track of the date. This can be seen as a sign of feeling isolated and alone, as if they are not connected to the world around them.
* **The post uses profane language:** The use of profane language in the post can be seen as a way to express frustration and anger, which can further contribute to feelings of isolation and exclusion.
* **The post is self-deprecating:** The author describes their life as a ""never-ending cycle of hell,"" which can be seen as self-deprecating and negative. This can also contribute to feelings of thwarted belongingness, as it can make the author feel like they are not worthy of belonging.

However, there are also some factors that might mitigate the risk of thwarted belongingness in this post:

* **The post is not explicitly directed at a specific group of people:** The author does not mention any specific group of people, so it is not clear whether they are targeting a particular audience or not.
* **The post expresses feelings of hopelessness rather than anger:** While the post does express feelings of frustration and anger, it does not seem to be aimed at attacking or blaming others. Instead, it seems to be more about the author's own feelings of hopelessness and despair.

Overall, the post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness due to the feelings of isolation, despair, and self-deprecation that are expressed. However, the fact that the post is not explicitly directed at a specific group of people and the fact that the author expresses feelings of hopelessness rather than anger might mitigate the risk of thwarted belongingness."

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author's tone is extremely negative and bleak, describing their life as a ""never ending cycle of hell."" They express feeling ""stuck"" and ""trapped"" in a cycle of daily routines that offer no sense of accomplishment or satisfaction. The use of profanity and the exaggerated language (""fucking same,"" ""hell"") further contribute to the sense of negativity and despair.

While the author acknowledges that they don't keep track of the date anymore, the focus of their post is not on the passage of time or the lack of temporal awareness. Instead, it's on the feeling of sameness and the perceived lack of purpose in their life. The post paints a picture of a life where each day feels the same, offering no sense of progression or improvement.

Therefore, while the post may not explicitly mention physical or emotional burdens, it does show risk of perceived burdensomeness due to the author's negative outlook and the sense of entrapment they express."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

**Here's why:**

* **The post creates a sense of shared experience:** It acknowledges that others are experiencing the same issue, using the phrase ""any other late night r/depression browsers."" This can make individuals feel less alone and more connected to others.
* **The post creates a sense of community:** It encourages interaction by inviting others to share their experiences in the comments. This can foster a sense of community and belonging among individuals who struggle with depression.
* **However, the post also creates a sense of exclusion:** It uses the phrase ""r/depression browsers"" which may exclude individuals who don't identify as depressed or who don't use Reddit. This can create a sense of exclusion and alienation for some.

Overall, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness due to the potential for exclusion and the creation of both a sense of shared experience and community. While the post can foster connection and belonging for some, it may also inadvertently exclude others."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling dread for tomorrow, which indicates a negative anticipation of the future. While it does not explicitly mention feeling like a burden, the experience of dread can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.

3. However, the presence of a smiley face at the end of the post suggests a possible attempt to mask or downplay the negative emotions. This could indicate a desire to appear more positive or hide one's true feelings, which may make it less likely that the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The poster explicitly states that they are using Reddit instead of going to sleep due to their dread for tomorrow. This implies that the poster feels that their depression is so severe that they are unable to sleep even when they have the opportunity to rest. This perception of burdensomeness is a common symptom of depression and can be very distressing for those affected.

Here are some additional points that support the conclusion:

* **The post uses humor, but the underlying tone is serious:** The poster's use of humor in the title and comment (""Any other late night r/depression browsers?"") may be seen as a coping mechanism to lighten the mood of the post. However, the underlying tone is still serious and reflects the poster's genuine struggle with depression.
* **The post mentions ""dread for tomorrow"":** The poster's use of the phrase ""dread for tomorrow"" is a strong indicator of their feelings of hopelessness and anxiety about the future. This feeling of dread is a common symptom of depression and can be very debilitating.
* **The post seeks support:** The poster ends the post with a question ("":)""), indicating that they are seeking support from the community. This shows that the poster is aware of the challenges they are facing and is willing to reach out for help.

Overall, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness due to the poster's explicit statement about their inability to sleep, the presence of symptoms like dread for tomorrow, and the overall tone of the post. While the poster may be using humor to cope with their struggles, the underlying reality is that they are experiencing a significant burden due to their depression."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

The post describes vivid dreams and a feeling of being back in childhood, which could be interpreted as a desire for belonging and connection to a simpler time. However, the presence of depression and dissociation suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness.

**Here's why:**

* **Depression:** Depression can lead to feelings of isolation and alienation, making it difficult to connect with others and feel like you belong.
* **Dissociation:** Dissociation can cause a disconnect from oneself and the world around you, making it difficult to engage in social activities and build relationships.

These factors combined can create a significant barrier to feeling like you belong, even in your own dreams. The post describes feeling like being in a different realm/world, which could be interpreted as a metaphor for feeling alienated from your current reality.

Therefore, while the post describes a desire for belonging and connection to a simpler time, the presence of depression and dissociation suggests a risk of thwarted belongingness.

**Additional factors to consider:**

* The post does not provide enough information about the author's age, gender, or other relevant factors that could influence their experience of belongingness.
* The post does not describe the severity of the author's depression or dissociation or the impact it has on their daily life.
* The post does not provide any information about the author's support network or coping mechanisms for managing their mental health.

Considering these additional factors, a more complete assessment of the risk of thwarted belongingness would be necessary."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not directly mention or indicate any feelings of burden or thoughts of being better off gone. It primarily focuses on discussing dreams, mental illness, and a feeling of being in a different realm.
2. The mention of mental illness, specifically depression and dissociation, may suggest potential risk factors for perceived burdensomeness. However, without any explicit statements or indications of feeling like a burden or wanting to escape, it is difficult to determine the presence of perceived burdensomeness in this post.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

The post describes vivid dreams and a feeling of being back in childhood, which could be interpreted as a positive experience. However, the mention of depression and dissociation suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.

**Here's why:**

* **Depression:** Depression can lead to feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and fatigue. These symptoms could make it difficult for the author to perceive their dreams as positive or enjoyable.
* **Dissociation:** Dissociation can cause feelings of estrangement from oneself and the world around you. This could further contribute to the feeling of being in a different realm/world, but it could also make it difficult for the author to engage with their dreams in a meaningful way.

Therefore, while the post describes a positive experience of vivid dreams and a feeling of nostalgia, the presence of depression and dissociation symptoms suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.

**Additional factors:**

* The author's use of language like ""burdened"" and ""different realm/world"" could also indicate a sense of alienation and isolation.
* The post does not provide enough information about the author's specific experiences with depression and dissociation, so it is difficult to assess the full extent of the risk of perceived burdensomeness.

**Overall:**

While the post describes a positive experience, the presence of depression and dissociation symptoms suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness. It is important to remember that this is just a single post and does not represent the experiences of all people with mental illness."

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author's tone is very negative and self-deprecating, and they express feeling like their sadness is not being noticed or understood. This could lead others to perceive the author as being overly dramatic or attention-seeking, which could further exacerbate their feelings of sadness and isolation.

Here are some specific examples of how the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness:

* **The author's focus on their own problems:** The post is primarily about the author's own issues with sadness and self-harm, rather than their friends' concerns about therapy. This could make it seem like the author is more concerned with their own well-being than with the well-being of their friends.
* **The author's use of self-deprecating language:** The author uses language that is very negative and self-deprecating, such as ""No one seems to notice when I'm sad"" and ""No one even says anything when I bearly talk."" This could make it seem like the author is exaggerating their sadness and making it seem like a bigger deal than it is.
* **The author's expectation of sympathy:** The author expects others to understand and sympathize with their sadness, but they don't seem to be willing to reciprocate that sympathy. This could make it seem like the author is taking advantage of others' empathy.

Overall, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness due to the author's negative tone, self-deprecating language, and their expectation of sympathy.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

The post does show some risk of thwarted belongingness, although not necessarily in the way you might think.

**Here's why:**

* **The post describes feeling sad and hopeless:** The author feels ""sad"" and ""hopeless"" at the thought of the patient not waking up. This feeling of sadness and hopelessness can make it feel like the author is isolating themselves from others and not able to connect with others in a meaningful way.
* **The post describes feeling detached from the patient:** The author states that they ""don't feel anything"" towards the patient and that ""nothing can hurt them or make them feel sad."" This feeling of detachment from the patient can make it difficult for the author to relate to the patient's suffering and to feel empathy for their situation.

However, the post also includes some elements that mitigate the risk of thwarted belongingness:

* **The author acknowledges their sadness:** The author openly acknowledges their sadness and acknowledges that it is a normal reaction to the situation. This self-awareness can help others to understand and empathize with the author's feelings.
* **The author still wants to help:** Despite feeling sad, the author still wants to see the patient wake up and be well again. This shows that the author is not completely withdrawn from the situation and still has a desire to help others.

Overall, the post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but the author's self-awareness and their continued desire to help others mitigate this risk. It is important to remember that this post is just a snapshot of the author's experience and does not necessarily represent their overall emotional state or their ability to connect with others."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The user describes their friend's loss of a friend to suicide and their own lack of experience with such a tragedy. This could lead to feelings of not belonging, as the user may feel like they are not able to understand or relate to their friend's grief.

## Analysis

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the poster expresses concern for their friend's mental health and offers support, the language used can come across as slightly self-centered and potentially overwhelming for the friend.

* **""I‚Äôm worried about him"":** This statement can come across as overly dramatic and may make the friend feel like the poster is exaggerating their concern.
* **""What can I do to make this easier for him?""**: This question can be seen as self-centered and may make the friend feel like the poster is more concerned about their own well-being than their friend's.

**Overall, the post shows some risk of perceived burdensomeness, although the poster's intentions are clearly good.** The language used could be more empathetic and less self-centered. Additionally, the poster could offer more specific suggestions for how they can help their friend cope with their grief."

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

The post describes feeling isolated and distrustful, and expresses concerns about not being able to find real friends. This can be perceived as burdensomeness by others, as it implies that the writer is negative and difficult to be around.

4. While the post does not directly mention perceived burdensomeness, it does highlight a potential risk factor for mental disturbance, such as substance abuse and engaging in risky behaviors. However, without explicit mention of feeling like a burden or thoughts of being better off gone, it cannot be concluded that the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author describes their experience with opiates as ""fucking stupid and irresponsible,"" and emphasizes the potential loss of everything due to one night's actions. This language paints a picture of the experience as being incredibly burdensome and shameful, potentially making others perceive the author as being overly dramatic or even seeking attention.

Here's a breakdown of the elements that contribute to the perceived burdensomeness:

* **Self-deprecating language:** The author uses strong negative language like ""fucking stupid"" and ""irresponsible"" to describe their own actions. This language can be seen as self-deprecating and may make others feel uncomfortable or even judgemental.
* **Fear of loss:** The author emphasizes the potential loss of everything due to their actions. This fear of loss can be perceived as burdensome and may make others feel concerned about the author's well-being.
* **Shame:** The author mentions feeling ""shamed"" by their actions. This feeling of shame can be perceived as burdensome and may make others feel sympathetic or even concerned about the author's mental health.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

The post describes symptoms of anxiety and distress, but does not explicitly mention feelings of exclusion or alienation. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer whether the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

Additionally, the statement ""I've just been awfully down"" suggests a feeling of despondency and hopelessness, which could also be linked to thwarted belongingness.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author feels isolated and alone, with no friends to talk to and feeling like their relationship is pushing them away. This feeling of isolation and exclusion is a key component of thwarted belongingness.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author feels like they are not able to measure up to the standard of their loved one, and this feeling of inadequacy can lead to feelings of thwarted belongingness.

## Analysis

This post shows some potential risk of thwarted belongingness, although not necessarily high risk. Here's why:

**Potential risk factors:**

* **Social comparison:** The post explicitly mentions seeking a self-help book for anxiety and depression, which could lead others to compare their own experiences with the poster's and feel inadequate.
* **Fear of rejection:** The poster's vulnerability about their mental health could make others worry about whether they will be judged or excluded for sharing similar experiences.
* **Need for approval:** The post seeks recommendations for self-help books, which could imply a need for approval from the community.

**However, there are also factors that mitigate the risk:**

* **The post is not overly personal:** The poster does not share intimate details about their experiences with anxiety and depression, which could make others feel uncomfortable.
* **The post is open-ended:** The poster does not ask for specific book recommendations, which could make it easier for others to share their own experiences without feeling obligated to provide a specific book suggestion.
* **The post is focused on self-help:** The post is primarily about seeking help for mental health, rather than seeking social approval or validation.

Overall, while this post shows some potential risk factors for thwarted belongingness, the overall risk is relatively low. The post is not overly personal, and the focus on self-help rather than social approval or validation helps to mitigate the risk.

**Additional notes:**

* This analysis is based on the limited information available in the post. More information about the context of the post, such as the poster's age, gender, and social network, could help to further assess the risk of thwarted belongingness.
* The presence of risk factors does not necessarily mean that the post will lead to thwarted belongingness. The actual impact on the reader will depend on their individual experiences and sensitivities."

They feel like they are bringing down others, rather than contributing positively to their lives.

While the author acknowledges that people may not want to be around them, their self-perception as a burden is likely inaccurate.

## Analysis

This post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but not necessarily.

**Risk factors:**

* **Self-disclosure:** The author explicitly states that it is difficult for them to ask for help and that their request was ignored. This self-disclosure can lead others to perceive the author as being vulnerable and dependent on others.
* **Negative emotions:** The author expresses feelings of frustration and helplessness (""getting straight up ignored"") and describes the situation as ""just getting worse and worse."" These negative emotions can make the author feel isolated and excluded from others.

**However, there are also some mitigating factors:**

* **Self-deprecation:** The author acknowledges that their request was ignored and does not blame others for their situation. This self-deprecation can help to reduce the risk of others perceiving them as being overly dramatic or needy.
* **Focus on personal agency:** The author states that they will ""suck it up and push it down,"" indicating their willingness to persevere despite the challenges. This self-reliance can help to offset the negative emotions and make the author appear more resilient.

**Overall, the post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but the presence of mitigating factors reduces the severity of the risk.** The author's vulnerability and negative emotions are evident, but their self-deprecation and agency provide some balance.

**Additional notes:**

* The post does not provide enough information about the context of the situation or the specific relationship between the author and the people who ignored their request for help. This makes it difficult to fully assess the risk of thwarted belongingness.
* The author's tone is somewhat negative and self-deprecating, which may contribute to the feeling of thwarted belongingness.
* The author's use of humor (""suck it up and push it down"") may also help to offset the negative emotions and make the post more relatable."

## Analysis

This post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but not necessarily.

**Risk factors:**

* **Self-disclosure:** The poster shares their personal experience of reading a self-help book, which could be seen as revealing their vulnerability and seeking approval from the community.
* **Inquisitive tone:** The poster asks for thoughts and recommendations, which can be interpreted as seeking guidance and validation from the community.
* **Uncertain outcome:** The poster states that the book is ""working"" for them, but they haven't finished reading it yet. This uncertainty could lead others to question whether the book will be successful for them, which could contribute to feelings of exclusion.

**However, there are also some mitigating factors:**

* **Open-endedness:** The poster's question is open-ended, inviting others to share their own experiences and opinions. This can create a sense of inclusivity and community.
* **Positive framing:** The poster's tone is positive and enthusiastic, which can create a welcoming atmosphere.
* **Self-awareness:** The poster acknowledges that their experience may not be universal, and they are open to different perspectives.

Overall, the post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but the presence of mitigating factors reduces the potential impact. The poster's vulnerability, openness to feedback, and positive framing create a more inclusive atmosphere.

## Analysis

This post does show some risk of perceived burdensomeness, although not necessarily in the way you might think.

**Here's why:**

* **The post is centered around self-help:** Self-help books often carry a perception of being time-consuming and requiring effort to read and implement. This post explicitly mentions a self-help book, which could reinforce this perception.
* **The post asks for a recommendation:** The asker is explicitly asking for a recommendation, which implies that they are seeking guidance and advice from others. This can make others feel like they are being burdened with their time and expertise.
* **The post is vague:** The asker does not provide any details about the book or their reading experience, making it difficult for others to judge whether the book is relevant to their own needs. This vagueness can further contribute to the feeling of burdensomeness.

**However, there are also some mitigating factors:**

* **The post is positive:** The asker expresses excitement about the book and uses phrasing like ""working for me"" which can be seen as positive and relatable.
* **The post is open-ended:** The asker does not expect others to provide a full book recommendation or engage in a lengthy discussion. They simply ask for general thoughts and whether the book would be recommended.
* **The asker is not demanding:** The asker does not use forceful language or make demands on others. They are simply asking for sharing their experiences and opinions.

Overall, the post does show some risk of perceived burdensomeness, but the mitigating factors help to reduce this risk. The asker's tone is positive, the post is open-ended, and the asker is not demanding. However, the focus on self-help books and the request for a recommendation can still make some people feel like they are being burdened."

The post also mentions the feeling of ""stuttering"" when trying to let the voices out. This imagery evokes feelings of frustration, helplessness, and inadequacy.

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The writer clearly states their dream university offer was declined, which could lead to feelings of exclusion and disappointment. They also describe feeling ""broken,"" which further indicates the severity of their emotional distress.

**Here's why:**

* **Exclusion:** The post describes feeling ""excluded"" from their dream university. This feeling aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness, where an individual feels like they do not belong or are not welcome in a particular group or environment.
* **Disappointment:** The writer was ""sure"" of their offer being accepted, so the decline is a significant source of disappointment. This disappointment can also contribute to feelings of exclusion and hopelessness.
* **Emotional distress:** The post states that the writer is ""broken"" due to the decline. This indicates the severity of their emotional distress and the profound impact the event has had on their well-being.

**Answer:** Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

The post describes the user's feeling of being ""broken"" due to the decline of their offer to their dream university. This language can be perceived as overly dramatic and may come across as burdensome to some readers. The user's exaggerated emotional response may make it seem like they are seeking sympathy or attention rather than seeking advice or support.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author clearly states their discomfort with their coworkers and their feeling of being ""messed up"" due to the upcoming work day. This indicates a feeling of exclusion and marginalization from the workplace environment.

**Here's why:**

* **The author feels uncomfortable around their coworkers:** This discomfort is a key symptom of thwarted belongingness. When an individual feels uncomfortable in their work environment, it can be due to a lack of sense of belonging or feeling like they don't fit in.
* **The author feels ""messed up"" due to work:** This feeling of being ""messed up"" is also a common symptom of thwarted belongingness.

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author explicitly states that they are ""messed up in the head"" knowing they have to go to work tomorrow. This language implies that the author feels overwhelmed and stressed by the situation, which could be perceived as burdensomeness by others.

Here's why:

* **The author's tone is negative and self-deprecating:** They use words like ""messed up"" and ""really just messed up"" to describe their state of mind. This negativity can be contagious and make others perceive the situation as more burdensome than it actually is.
* **The author's focus is on their own discomfort:** The post primarily focuses on the author's own discomfort and stress, rather than the potential impact on others. This can make it difficult for others to understand the situation from a broader perspective.
* **The author's language is exaggerated:** The author's language may be slightly exaggerated for dramatic effect. They may not actually be as ""messed up"" as they imply.

## Analysis

The post describes a perspective that emphasizes the lack of consequence and freedom associated with death. While the author acknowledges the inevitability of death, they seem to find solace in the idea that nothing matters and that they can do whatever they want without worry. This perspective, while seemingly carefree, raises concerns about potential perceived burdensomeness.

**Potential perceived burdensomeness:**

* **Lack of empathy:** The post emphasizes the author's own feelings and struggles while disregarding the potential impact on others. The statement ""I take whatever I want, all the time"" implies a disregard for the consequences of their actions on others. This lack of empathy could lead to insensitive and hurtful behavior.

* **Disengagement:** The post describes a state of disengagement from the world and the potential for emotional disconnect. The author's focus on their own well-being and indifference towards the well-being of others could lead to emotional neglect and difficulty forming meaningful connections.

**Conclusion:**

While the post acknowledges the inevitability of death, the author's perspective on its implications appears to be overly focused on their own well-being and lack of concern for others. This perspective raises concerns about potential perceived burdensomeness and the potential for insensitive, entitled, and emotionally detached behavior.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The user describes feeling ""sensitive"" and needing to talk to a therapist about a ""sensitive topic."" They also mention leaving their last therapist due to lack of time and feeling like the online barrier helps them be ""completely honest."" These elements all point to the user feeling like they may not be able to find a sense of belonging in their current circumstances.

**Here's why:**

* **Feeling sensitive:** The user describes feeling ""sensitive"" which can be interpreted as feeling vulnerable and uncomfortable in their current situation.
* **Leaving a therapist:** Leaving a therapist can be a sign of feeling alienated or not being able to connect with the therapist on a personal level.
* **Online barrier:** The user mentions the online barrier helping them be ""completely honest"" which can be interpreted as them feeling more comfortable being open and vulnerable when they are not physically present with the therapist.

These factors combine to create a sense of thwarted belongingness for the user. They feel like they may not be able to find a safe and supportive space to talk about their sensitive topic, and this feeling of isolation can be very distressing.

**It is important to note that:**

* This post does not explicitly state that the user is suicidal or experiencing suicidal thoughts. Therefore, I cannot make a definitive statement about the risk of thwarted belongingness in relation to suicide.
* The user's language suggests that they are not currently suicidal, but they are seeking help for a sensitive topic and may be experiencing emotional distress.

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention any feelings of burden or thoughts of being better off gone. It solely expresses a need for someone to discuss a sensitive topic with, seeking advice and a safe space to be honest in.

3. The post explicitly states that the person is not suicidal and is seeking help. This indicates a proactive approach towards seeking support and does not align with the risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.","

## Analysis

While the post does not explicitly state suicidal intent, it does exhibit some potential signs of perceived burdensomeness:

* **The user's feeling of being unable to reach their therapist:** They state that they ""didn't have time to see her anymore,"" implying that they were unable to continue therapy due to time constraints. This could lead others to perceive the user as being unable to cope with their problems and feeling helpless.
* **The user's desire for anonymity:** They mention the ""online barrier"" helping them be ""completely honest"" with someone. This could be interpreted as the user feeling more comfortable expressing themselves openly when they are not physically present. This could be seen as a sign of their discomfort with the potential for others to know their personal information or concerns.
* **The user's use of emotional language:** They describe their feeling of being ""sad"" and ""looking for help."" While not explicitly stating suicidal intent, this language could be interpreted as hinting at their emotional distress and potential vulnerability.

Overall, while the post does not explicitly state suicidal intent, the presence of certain elements could lead others to perceive the user as being at risk of perceived burdensomeness. These elements include their feeling of being unable to reach their therapist, their desire for anonymity, and their use of emotional language. It is important to remember that perceived burdensomeness is not necessarily indicative of actual suicidal intent.

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author expresses concern about being hated by their friend's friends and feeling like they are an ""awful person."" This indicates a fear of exclusion and rejection from the social group.

**Here are the elements that contribute to the risk of thwarted belongingness:**

* **Fear of negative evaluation:** The author worries about being hated, which is a fear of being negatively judged and perceived by others.
* **Sense of inadequacy:** The author feels like they are an ""awful person,"" which reinforces their feeling of inadequacy and unworthiness.
* **Social isolation:** The post suggests that the author may feel isolated and alone, as they are concerned about their relationship with their friend and their ability to fit in with his friends.

**However, there are also some factors that may mitigate the risk:**

* **The author's self-awareness:** They acknowledge their own flaws and admit that they are ""awful."" This self-awareness can help them to manage their expectations and understand their own role in the situation.
* **The potential for reconciliation:** The author mentions that they have a big fight with their bff, but they may be open to reconciliation and repairing their relationship.
* **The possibility of support:** The author may have other friends or support networks that can provide comfort and understanding during this difficult time.

Overall, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness, but the presence of some mitigating factors may help to reduce the severity of the situation."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions having a fight with a best friend and expressing concern about their upcoming birthday. This indicates potential interpersonal conflict and social anxiety, but does not directly mention feeling like a burden or thoughts of being better off gone.
2. The post states a fear of being hated by the friend's other friends and self-identifies as an awful person. While this suggests low self-esteem and self-blame, it does not necessarily indicate perceived burdensomeness.
3. The response also does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness. It acknowledges the concern and expresses understanding of the fear of being disliked, but does not reinforce or validate feelings of being a burden.","

## Analysis

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author expresses concern about their friendship with their best friend and their potential exclusion from his upcoming birthday party. They acknowledge their own faults in the recent fight and feel that their behavior may have been ""awful."" This self-deprecation and recognition of their potential negative impact on the friendship contribute to the perception of burdensomeness.

Here are the specific elements that contribute to the perceived burdensomeness:

* **Self-blame:** The author states that they ""can't blame"" their behavior, which implies that they are unwilling to take responsibility for their actions. This can be seen as self-deprecating and may make others feel that the author is making excuses or not taking the situation seriously.
* **Fear of exclusion:** The author expresses fear that their presence at the party will be unwelcome due to their recent fight with their best friend. This fear can be seen as irrational or overblown, but it can also make others feel that the author is overly dramatic or self-centered.
* **Focus on self-pity:** The author's tone is primarily focused on their own feelings of guilt and shame, rather than on the potential impact their actions may have on their friend or others. This self-absorption can be seen as insensitive and may make others feel that the author is not concerned about the well-being of others.

Overall, while the author acknowledges their own faults and expresses concern about their friendship, their self-blame, fear of exclusion, and focus on self-pity contribute to the perception of burdensomeness."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author feels like they are not meant to feel positive emotions and that feeling positive emotions is unnatural. This feeling of exclusion and isolation is a common symptom of thwarted belongingness. Additionally, the author's self-sabotage behavior and their desire to kill themselves are also indicators of thwarted belongingness.

The author's post is a cry for help, but they have rejected all suggestions for help. They feel that any help would mean they would not feel depressed all the time, which is unnatural and bad. This is a common misconception about depression. Depression is not a condition that can be cured, but it can be managed with treatment. The author's belief that feeling happy is unnatural is also a misconception. Happiness is a natural human emotion that everyone experiences. It is not something that can be achieved or maintained consistently, but it is a worthwhile goal to strive for.

The author's self-sabotage behavior is also a sign of their thwarted belongingness. They are deliberately doing things that will make it difficult for them to succeed. This is a common coping mechanism for people who feel excluded and isolated. The author's desire to kill themselves is also a sign of their thwarted belongingness. They feel that they do not belong in the world and that the only way to escape their pain is to end their life.

These thoughts and actions further indicate a high risk of perceived burdensomeness.
3. The overall tone of the post is extremely negative and filled with despair, suggesting a deep sense of hopelessness and potential belief that others would be better off without them. This aligns with the core concept of perceived burdensomeness and confirms the need for intervention and support.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

**Explanation:**

The post describes a feeling of depression when the writer has a crush. This can be seen as a symptom of thwarted belongingness, as it suggests that the writer feels like they do not fit in with others.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The user feels depressed and sad all the time and wants to talk about it, but their friends seem to ignore it and talk about something else. This can be very hurtful and make the user feel like they are not being listened to or understood. It also contributes to the feeling of isolation and loneliness that can be experienced when going through a difficult time.

The user's feeling of thwarted belongingness is exacerbated by the fact that they are going through a difficult time with their parents' divorce and the death of their grandparents. These events are likely to be very upsetting for the user and can be difficult to cope with. The fact that their friends are not able to provide them with the support and understanding they need is likely to make the situation even worse.

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The user's language paints a picture of despair and hopelessness, and the tone is very negative. They feel depressed and sad all the time, and their friends seem to be ignoring their problems. This could lead others to perceive the user as being overly dramatic or seeking attention.

However, the post does not explicitly state intentions of self-harm or suicide. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say whether the user is at risk of self-harm or suicide.

**Here are some factors that could contribute to the perceived burdensomeness:**

* **The user's language:** They use strong words like ""shit"" and ""all the time"" to describe their feelings.
* **The user's tone:** The post is written in a very negative tone, and the user's voice is likely to be low and subdued.

**It is important to remember that:**

* This post is not a diagnosis of mental illness.

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post mentions feeling like the poster might have posted in the wrong subreddit and apologizing for that.

Additionally, the poster's desire to help a lot of people and their openness to chat with others could make some users feel uncomfortable or like they are being used."

2. The post expresses a passion for helping people and a desire to learn more about the topic. This indicates a positive mindset and a willingness to support others.
3. The response does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness either. It is a polite acknowledgment of the post and a willingness to engage in conversation or provide support.","

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the author apologizes for posting in the wrong subreddit, the overall tone of the post feels a bit self-centered and demanding. The author emphasizes their own passion for helping people and their desire to help a lot of people, but the focus on their own goals and desires can make it seem like they are imposing their own agenda on the reader.

Here are some specific examples of perceived burdensomeness in the post:

* **The author's apology feels hollow:** The author apologizes for posting in the wrong subreddit, but they don't apologize for the inconvenience their post may have caused to others.
* **The author's tone is overly self-centered:** The author talks about their own passion and desire to help people, but they don't mention the needs or concerns of the reader.
* **The author's request is demanding:** The author asks the reader to listen to their explanation of the career and to share their problems and concerns. This can be seen as a burden on the reader, especially if they are not interested in the author's topic or have their own problems to deal with.

Overall, the post shows some risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the author has a genuine desire to help people, their self-centered tone and demanding request can make it difficult for readers to feel comfortable engaging with them."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions feeling depressed and having thoughts of hopelessness. This indicates a potential sense of emotional pain or distress.
2. They express a belief that God or angels will help them, suggesting a potential desire for support and connection.
3. The individual mentions difficulty accepting their own depressing thoughts, which could indicate a struggle with acknowledging and managing their emotions.
Overall, the post reflects risk of thwarted belongingness as the individual appears to be experiencing emotional pain and seeking support or connection from external sources.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author's struggles with depression and their belief in angels and divine intervention are personal and intimate. However, the post also reveals a fear of not being understood or supported by others.

**Here's why:**

* **The author feels depressed to the point where it gives them hope:** This suggests a deep level of despair and hopelessness. It also hints at the feeling of being trapped in a cycle of negative thoughts and emotions.
* **The author feels unable to accept their depression:** They express frustration and disbelief at their inability to accept their condition. This feeling of helplessness and self-blame can further contribute to feelings of isolation and exclusion.
* **The author's belief in angels and divine intervention is tied to their coping mechanism:** Their belief in angels and divine intervention is a way for them to find comfort and hope amidst their depression. If they lose faith in this belief, it could be seen as a loss of their coping mechanism and a further source of distress.
* **The author's ending statement emphasizes their feeling of helplessness:** They state that they end believing in angels and that someone will help them, implying that they feel hopeless and alone.

While the post does not explicitly state the author's social context or their relationship with others, the underlying themes of depression, self-doubt, and fear of isolation suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness. The author's struggles are personal and intimate, but their fear of not being understood or supported by others is a common experience for individuals with mental health challenges.

Therefore, while the post showcases the author's personal journey and their unique coping mechanisms, it also highlights the risk of thwarted belongingness associated with their depression and their reliance on belief in angels and divine intervention."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling depressed and having thoughts of hope. While depression can be a risk factor for perceived burdensomeness, the mention of hope suggests that the individual is not currently experiencing thoughts of being better off gone.
2. The post also mentions a belief in God and angels, suggesting a belief in a higher power and the possibility of receiving help. This belief can provide a sense of support and counteract feelings of burdensomeness.
3. The post indicates a difficulty accepting the presence of depressing thoughts, which implies a desire to seek help and find support. This attitude is not consistent with perceived burdensomeness, as it suggests a willingness to reach out for assistance.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author describes feeling so depressed that it gives them hope, implying that their depression is so severe that it brings them a sense of peace and acceptance. This perception of burdensomeness is evident in the author's statement ""I cannot accept I am dealing with such depressing thoughts"" and ""And that someone will help me.""

The author's belief that their depression is so severe that it brings them hope and their reliance on the idea that someone will help them are both indicative of perceived burdensomeness. They feel that their depression is so overwhelming that it is beyond their ability to cope with on their own and that they need external assistance to overcome it.

While the post does not explicitly state the author's intent, the overall tone suggests that they are seeking empathy and understanding from others. They are sharing their experience in the hope that others can relate and offer support. However, the perception of burdensomeness may be unintentionally conveyed, which could make it difficult for others to provide the support they need."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions feeling a sense of worthlessness, which suggests a possible lack of self-esteem or a negative self-perception.

## Analysis

This post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but not necessarily.

**Reasons for risk:**

* **The context is not pleasant:** The poster mentions the context of the subreddit being ""not really pleasant,"" which could make some members feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.
* **Self-deprecating language:** The poster uses self-deprecating language like ""my English is still too bad,"" which could make members feel that the poster doesn't belong or is not capable.
* **Lack of connection to the subreddit:** The post doesn't provide much information about the poster's connection to the subreddit or the topic of the subreddit, which could make members feel that the poster is not invested in the community.

**However, there are also factors that could mitigate the risk:**

* **The poster's self-presentation:** The poster introduces themselves as Matthew and expresses their desire to share their life and struggles. This could make members feel more open to the poster and their message.
* **The poster's willingness to learn:** The poster acknowledges their poor English and expresses their willingness to learn. This could make members feel that the poster is humble and willing to improve.
* **The poster's openness to feedback:** The poster does not mention whether they are open to feedback or suggestions, but if they were, it could make members feel that they can help the poster and make them feel more welcome.

Overall, the post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but the risk is not necessarily high. The poster's self-presentation, willingness to learn, and openness to feedback could mitigate the risk. However, the context of the subreddit and the poster's use of self-deprecating language could still make some members feel uncomfortable or unwelcome."

## Analysis

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the writer expresses pleasure in meeting everyone, the overall tone is quite negative and self-deprecating. The writer describes the context of the subreddit as ""not really pleasant"" and their own struggles as ""everyday struggles."" This creates a sense of negativity and hopelessness, which can be perceived as burdensomeness by others.

Here are some specific examples of how the post exhibits perceived burdensomeness:

* **Self-pity:** The writer uses phrases like ""my English is still too bad"" and ""struggles that come against me everyday"" which can be seen as self-pitying and may make others feel uncomfortable.
* **Negative focus:** The post primarily focuses on the writer's struggles and negative experiences, rather than their positive ones. This can create a sense of imbalance and make it difficult for others to relate to the writer on a positive level.
* **Unrealistic expectations:** The writer hopes that their messages can ""come to be of some use to somebody."" This expectation is unrealistic given the limited reach and impact of online posts. It can also make others feel like the writer is expecting too much from them.

Overall, while the writer expresses pleasure in meeting everyone, the negative and self-deprecating tone of the post creates a risk of perceived burdensomeness. The writer's struggles and negative focus can be seen as overwhelming and may make others feel uncomfortable or unwilling to engage with the post."

They mention watching others engage in happy and exciting activities, which further highlights their sense of isolation and potentially reinforces their feelings of not belonging. 3. The individual refers to the night as ""shitty"" and ""depressing-ass,"" indicating a negative emotional state that may be exacerbated by their perceived lack of connectedness.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author feels excluded from the revelry of others due to their sobriety. They describe the night as ""shitty"" and ""depressing"" and attribute this to their lack of alcohol. They also compare their experience to others' ""black-out drunk"" behavior, highlighting the feeling of being different.

The post also mentions ""Times Square kissing each other and doing anything at all in their lives at midnight,"" which further emphasizes the feeling of exclusion. The author feels like they are missing out on the fun and carefree atmosphere of others.

While the author acknowledges that their sobriety may be different from others', they still feel like an outsider. This feeling of being different and excluded can be very isolating and can lead to feelings of despondency and loneliness.

However, the post does contain some elements that could be perceived as burdensome by some readers. These include:

* **The author's self-pity:** The post sometimes feels like the author is whining about their sobriety. For example, they say ""that's what everyone else is doing anyway"" and ""in all my sober consciousness, I got to watch a bunch of happy excited people."" These statements could be seen as minimizing the author's struggles with sobriety and making readers feel like they are being judged for their own choices.
* **The author's lack of empathy:** The post does not show much empathy for others who might be struggling with similar issues.

## Analysis

This post shows some potential risk of thwarted belongingness, but not necessarily. Here's why:

**Risk factors:**

* **Self-doubt:** The poster states ""I just think it's my personality"" and ""I honeslty feel like I don't have depression."" These phrases indicate self-doubt and questioning their own reality. This can be a symptom of depression, even if the poster doesn't formally diagnose themselves.
* **Social isolation:** The post doesn't mention any social interaction or connections, which could contribute to feelings of isolation and exclusion.
* **Alcohol use:** The poster mentions being slightly drunk, which could exacerbate feelings of depression and anxiety.

**However, there are also factors that might mitigate the risk:**

* **Self-awareness:** The poster acknowledges their potential self-doubt and states that this is ""just how I am as a person."" This self-awareness is a positive sign and suggests the ability to reflect on and understand oneself.
* **Humor:** The post uses humor (""slightly drunk"") to lighten the mood and might indicate a coping mechanism for dealing with negative emotions.

3. Overall, the post does not explicitly mention feeling like a burden or expressing thoughts of being better off gone. It primarily focuses on their own perception of their mental state and attributing it to personality rather than depression.","

## Analysis

This post does show some risk of perceived burdensomeness, although not necessarily clinical depression. Here's why:

**Potential factors contributing to perceived burdensomeness:**

* **Self-deprecating language:** The poster uses phrases like ""I just think it's my personality"" and ""I honeslty feel like I don't have depression"" which can be interpreted as self-deprecating and downplaying their feelings.
* **Alcohol intoxication:** The poster mentions being slightly drunk, which could be influencing their mood and perception of themselves.
* **Social isolation:** The post does not mention any social context, so it's impossible to determine whether the poster is isolated or not.

**However, there are also factors that mitigate the risk of perceived burdensomeness:**

* **Humor:** The post has a humorous tone, evident in the use of sarcasm (""I honeslty feel like I don't have depression"") and self-deprecation (""I just think it's my personality"").
* **Self-awareness:** The poster acknowledges that their feeling might be influenced by their current state of intoxication and their personality.
* **Openness to feedback:** The post does not invite feedback or engage in discussion, so it's impossible to assess whether the poster would be receptive to suggestions or concerns about their perceived burdensomeness.

**Overall, while the post does show some risk of perceived burdensomeness, it is important to remember that this is not a clinical diagnosis.** The poster's self-reporting and the limited information available in the post make it difficult to determine their true emotional state.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

This post does show some risk of thwarted belongingness, although not necessarily in the way you might think.

* **The post ends on a note of self-deprecation and exhaustion.** This could make others feel like the poster is struggling to cope with their depression and that they might not be able to provide support or comfort.

However, there are also some factors that mitigate the risk of thwarted belongingness in this post:

* **The poster acknowledges that their depression is a worthy adversary.** This shows that they are aware of the challenges they are facing and that they are not giving up.
* **The poster expresses their willingness to try again tomorrow.** This shows that they are not giving up and that they are hopeful that they can overcome their depression.

Overall, the post shows some risk of thwarted belongingness, but the risk is mitigated by the poster's willingness to acknowledge their struggles, express their emotions, and seek support."
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions wanting to die every second of the day and feeling numb but depressed. This indicates a high level of distress and despair, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness. 
2. The post also mentions frustration and physically harming oneself as a way to release emotions. This suggests a lack of healthy coping mechanisms and a possible desire to escape from the emotional pain, both of which are associated with perceived burdensomeness. 
3. The post expresses disillusionment with love and life, indicating a lack of hope and satisfaction. This negative outlook on oneself and the world can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author describes feeling ""numb"" and ""depressed,"" and states that they ""can't even remember the last time I cried."" They also express frustration and anger, saying they ""couldn't fucking cry"" and that ""love sucks"" and ""money sucks."" These statements could be interpreted as conveying a sense of hopelessness and despair, which could be perceived as burdensome by others.

The author also mentions feeling ""like a fucking zombie"" and ""that's all the pill - turns me into a fucking zombie,"" which further reinforces the idea that they are feeling detached and isolated from others. These statements could be seen as expressing feelings of self-pity and hopelessness, which could also be perceived as burdensome by others.

Overall, while the author's post is honest and raw, it does show risk of perceived burdensomeness.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. While the author acknowledges that many songs are about breakups and sadness, they feel like there isn't much music that relates to their current low mood over life. This feeling of exclusion and isolation can be particularly distressing for those experiencing similar emotions.

Here's why:

* **The post highlights the lack of relatable music:** The author feels like there are no songs that capture their current state of depression. This lack of relatable music can exacerbate their feelings of isolation and loneliness.

While the post doesn't explicitly mention experiences of depression or anxiety, the combined effect of the author's vulnerability, their feeling of exclusion, and the language used to describe their low mood creates a risk of thwarted belongingness. It's important to remember that feeling sad or depressed doesn't necessarily mean that someone is seeking attention or trying to be dramatic. Sometimes, people simply need to express their emotions and find solace in shared experiences."

* **Lack of empathy:** The post focuses primarily on the writer's own sadness and lack of relatability to music. It doesn't consider the potential impact on others who might be struggling with similar feelings.
* **Unrealistic expectations:** The writer expects others to understand and relate to their specific sadness and experience. This could be seen as unrealistic and insensitive to others who may be going through different challenges.

* **""Everytime I feel like I had a special connection with someone it just fades off"":** This phrase highlights the perceived transience of relationships and may make the recipient feel like their connections with the writer may not be lasting.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author feels their life is meaningless and lacks purpose, which can be interpreted as feeling excluded or not belonging.

**Here's why:**

* **The author's feeling of meaninglessness:** They describe their life as feeling ""meaningless,"" which is a common symptom of thwarted belongingness. When people feel like they don't belong, they often experience a sense of meaninglessness and purposelessness.
* **The author's lack of purpose:** They state that their only fight is for a paycheck at the end of the month, implying that they lack other goals or purpose in life. This further reinforces their feeling of meaninglessness and lack of belonging.
* **The author's feeling of exclusion:** They may feel like they are excluded from others who have a sense of purpose and belonging in their lives. This feeling of exclusion can be very isolating and can exacerbate the feeling of meaninglessness.

**However, there are some factors that may mitigate the risk of thwarted belongingness:**

* **The author's use of language:** They use language that is not overly dramatic or self-deprecating. They acknowledge their feelings but do not dwell on them.
* **The author's openness to suggestions:** They do not explicitly state that they are not open to suggestions or advice. This may indicate that they are willing to seek support and guidance from others.

Overall, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness, but the author's use of language and their openness to suggestions may help to mitigate this risk."

## Analysis

This post does show some risk of thwarted belongingness. While the topic of depression is sensitive and personal, the post's tone is somewhat dismissive and lacks empathy. The poster's question ""Has anyone ever tried it?"" feels intrusive and insensitive, as it implies that people with depression are open to sharing their experiences. Additionally, the poster's use of the term ""reset"" to describe the process of treating depression is inaccurate and insensitive. Depression is not a condition that can be simply reset, and it requires professional help and support.

Overall, while the post does not explicitly promote exclusion or discrimination, it does create an environment that is not particularly welcoming or inclusive of people with depression. The poster's tone is too casual and dismissive, and the question is too intrusive and insensitive."

**Answer:** Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

This feeling of isolation and exclusion can be particularly distressing for individuals who value belonging and connection with others.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The writer feels different from the recipient and struggles to understand their feelings. They also feel helpless to help and are concerned about their upcoming visit. These feelings are all indicative of thwarted belongingness, which can lead to social anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.

**Here are some of the specific reasons why the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness:**

* **The writer feels different from the recipient:** They say, ""We are just so different I guess,"" which highlights their feeling of being different from the recipient.
* **The writer feels helpless to help:** They say, ""I just don't know how to help him somehow,"" which shows their feeling of helplessness and inability to provide support.
* **The writer is concerned about their upcoming visit:** They say, ""Is it a good idea to take origami paper to fold origami or play chess or something similar?"" which indicates their concern about not being able to connect with the recipient on a shared activity.
* **The writer feels isolated:** They are not living in the same city, which further isolates them from the recipient.

**Overall, the post shows a high risk of thwarted belongingness. The writer feels different, helpless, and isolated. These feelings are likely to be exacerbated by their upcoming visit and could lead to a range of negative emotions.**"
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention any feelings of burden or thoughts of being better off gone. It mainly focuses on the individual's desire to help someone else and their uncertainty about how to do so. 
2. The post does mention that the individual does not understand how the other person feels, suggesting a lack of empathy or shared experience. However, this does not necessarily indicate perceived burdensomeness.
3. The proposed idea of taking origami paper or playing chess as a new activity for the other person does not directly relate to perceived burdensomeness. It suggests a well-intentioned effort to engage and connect with the other person, but does not indicate any risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.","

**Answer:**

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

The poster's tone is one of desperation and helplessness. They feel they want to help but don't know how, and they're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. The poster's statement ""I try"" and ""I just don't know how"" convey a sense of helplessness and hopelessness.

The poster's suggestion of taking origami paper or playing chess also reflects their desire to find a way to connect with the recipient, but it's unlikely to be effective given the recipient's unfamiliarity with those activities. The poster's focus on their own desire to connect rather than the recipient's well-being further contributes to the perception of burdensomeness.

Overall, the post exhibits signs of perceived burdensomeness due to the poster's tone of desperation, helplessness, and their focus on their own desire to connect rather than the recipient's well-being."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In the given post, the individual is expressing thoughts about a potentially dangerous and life-threatening situation involving law enforcement. This post does not primarily indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness. Instead, it suggests a high risk of imminent harm to oneself and potentially to others. This post indicates a need for immediate intervention and support, potentially involving mental health professionals and emergency services.","

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The user's question involves a hypothetical scenario where they point a squirt gun that looks like a real gun at a cop and are shot. The user's intention is suicide. This post could be seen as problematic by some because it encourages self-harm and potentially promotes dangerous behavior.

**Here's why:**

* **The post normalizes suicide:** The user's question implies that suicide is a common or acceptable outcome, which is not true. Suicide is a serious issue and should not be taken lightly.
* **The post encourages self-harm:** The user's question is about how much trouble they would be in if they attempted suicide. This could encourage others to engage in self-harm or suicidal behavior.
* **The post promotes dangerous behavior:** The user's question involves a hypothetical scenario where they point a gun at a cop. This could encourage others to engage in similar behavior, which could lead to harm or even death.

**Therefore, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness because it could be seen as promoting self-harm and dangerous behavior.**"
"Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions pointing a squirt gun that looks like a real gun at a cop and mentions intentions of suicide. The act of pointing a gun-like object at a police officer can be seen as a threat and can escalate the situation, potentially putting both the individual and the officer in danger. 2. The post also mentions having no real weapon, which suggests that the intention was not to harm the officer, but rather to provoke a response to potentially end one's own life. However, law enforcement may still interpret this as a dangerous situation and take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of themselves and others. 3. The post demonstrates a level of distress and desperation, as the individual is contemplating extreme actions with a focus on the potential consequences. This indicates a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may feel that their existence is a burden and that their only solution is through a potentially life-threatening act.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the poster explicitly states their intentions are suicide and have no real weapon, the post still creates a situation where a cop might perceive a threat and react accordingly.

Here's why:

* **Squirting gun resemblance:** The poster mentions a squirt gun that looks like a real gun. This similarity could lead a cop to mistake the squirt gun for a real weapon, especially in a tense situation.
* **Suicide intentions:** The poster explicitly states their intentions are suicide. This information could lead a cop to believe that the poster is a potential danger to themselves and others, even if they don't have a real weapon.
* **Unclear intent:** The post doesn't explicitly state whether the poster wants to harm others or themselves. This ambiguity could further lead a cop to perceive a threat, even if the poster has no real weapon.

While the poster clearly states their intentions and has no real weapon, the post still creates a situation where a cop might perceive a threat and react accordingly. This is because of the similarity between the squirt gun and a real gun, the poster's stated intentions of suicide, and the lack of clarity regarding their intent.

Therefore, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual expresses feelings of deep pain and despair, as well as thoughts of self-harm. However, when considering the interpersonal risk factors of mental disturbance, there is no specific mention of a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness.

* **Making fun of someone for being skinny:** This is a common form of bullying and can be very hurtful. It's not appropriate to make fun of someone for their body size or any other physical characteristic.

* **Jabbing at your other friend:** This is also a form of bullying and can be very hurtful. It's not appropriate to make fun of someone for their mistakes.
* **Complaining about people making fun of you:** If you're going to complain about people making fun of you, you need to be willing to change your own behavior. If you're not willing to change, then you're probably being hypocritical.

Overall, the post shows a high risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author's language is inflammatory and hurtful, and their behavior is self-centered and hypocritical. It's important to remember that words can have a powerful impact on others. It's not appropriate to make fun of or bully others.

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post describes feeling like one is losing the mental fortitude to do most tasks that would supposedly improve wellbeing. This feeling of loss of ability and inability to complete tasks can be very isolating and lead to feelings of not belonging. The poster also mentions feeling discouraged and depressed due to bad memories and thoughts accompanying every task, which further reinforces the feeling of not being able to keep up with others.

The post also includes phrases that are characteristic of thwarted belongingness, such as ""I feel like I'm slowly losing the mental fortitude to do most tasks"" and ""I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do things anymore."" These phrases highlight the feeling of helplessness and hopelessness that can be experienced when feeling thwarted.

Overall, the post demonstrates the risk of thwarted belongingness through the use of language that describes feelings of loss of ability, isolation, and hopelessness."

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. While the author acknowledges that it's ""like every other lonely night,"" the use of phrases like ""urgent sense of isolation"" and ""sadder pit of regret"" can make the reader feel burdened and overwhelmed.

Here's why:

* **Comparison to ""every other lonely night"":** While the author attempts to downplay the situation by comparing it to ""every other lonely night,"" the phrasing still emphasizes the repetitiveness and sameness of the experience. This can make the reader feel like the author is minimizing their own feelings and making it seem like the problem is not significant.
* **Sense of urgency and despair:** The phrase ""urgent sense of isolation"" evokes a feeling of helplessness and despair. It suggests that the author feels alone and isolated to the point where they can't find comfort in even the familiarity of a lonely night. This can be perceived as burdensome by the reader, as it can make them feel concerned about the author's well-being and their ability to cope with the situation.

"No, the post does not show this risk.

**Answer:**

The post raises concerns about the potential for thwarted belongingness, but it does not explicitly exhibit the symptoms of thwarted belongingness.

**Explanation:**

* **Potential for Thwarted Belongingness:**
   - The post questions the genuineness of the phrase ""you deserve better than me,"" which could lead to feelings of exclusion and marginalization.
   - It also suggests that the phrase is equivalent to ""I'm sorry,"" which could reinforce negative perceptions of the speaker.

* **Lack of Symptoms of Thwarted Belongingness:**
   - The post does not include any explicit symptoms of thwarted belongingness, such as self-doubt, shame, or anxiety about fitting in.
   - The tone is more analytical and questioning than emotional.

**Conclusion:**

While the post raises concerns about the potential for thwarted belongingness, it does not explicitly exhibit the symptoms of the condition. The post primarily focuses on the semantic ambiguity of the phrase ""you deserve better than me"" and its potential to cause exclusion. It does not delve into the emotional impact or personal experiences associated with thwarted belongingness."

**Answer:**

The post shows some risk of perceived burdensomeness.

This could lead others to perceive the author as being negative, self-pitying, or even demanding.

## Analysis

The post describes a distressing experience related to self-reflection and self-perception. The author feels disgust when seeing their reflection, making it difficult to engage with mirrors.

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The post describes a feeling of being alone in a large, dark room, regardless of whether the author is alone or with people. This feeling is likely to be experienced by people who feel ostracized or excluded from their social groups. The author's use of the phrase ""professional hell blabla"" also suggests that they may be feeling frustrated and helpless, which further contributes to the risk of thwarted belongingness.

While the post does not explicitly mention anxiety or depression, the symptoms described are similar to those of both disorders. If the author is experiencing these symptoms regularly, it is important for them to seek professional help."

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Here's why:

* **The post describes a feeling of being alone and isolated:** The author feels like they are alone in a large, dark room, regardless of whether they are alone or with people. This feeling of isolation can be perceived as burdensome, especially if it is frequent or overwhelming.
* **The post uses humor but also hints at seriousness:** The author acknowledges the unprofessional nature of their question and uses humor to downplay the severity of their experience. However, the underlying feeling of isolation and unease remains, which can be perceived as burdensome.
* **The post lacks context:** The author does not provide enough information about their experiences or the frequency of these feelings. Without more context, it is difficult to assess the severity of the perceived burdensomeness.

Overall, while the post uses humor and attempts to downplay the severity of the experience, the feeling of isolation and unease described can be perceived as burdensome by some readers. The lack of context and the ambiguous nature of the experience further contribute to the perceived burdensomeness."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual mentions experiencing chronic headaches and passing out, and wonders if it may be related to their depression.

**Answer:**

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

The poster's description of their headaches and passing out due to them, as well as their feeling of not being able to find a cause for their symptoms, could lead others to perceive them as being abnormal or different from others.

This self-sacrificing attitude can be seen as a way to gain belonging and approval from others. However, it also carries the risk of burnout and exhaustion, which can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion.

**However, there are also some factors that mitigate the risk of thwarted belongingness:**

* **The author's tone is positive and determined:** Despite their fear of dying, the author maintains a positive and determined tone. They state their intention to ""push on"" and do their best for others. This can be seen as a way to inspire others and create a sense of community.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness.

## Answer

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author's tone is very negative and self-deprecating, focusing on their own feelings of hopelessness and stagnation. They describe their life as ""useless"" and ""miserable,"" and express feelings of being ""stuck in bed"" and ""unable to move."" This language can be seen as conveying a sense of burden and despair, which could be perceived by others as manipulative or self-pitying.

While the author acknowledges that others are celebrating and expressing optimism about the future, their own focus on their own negative emotions and self-pitying language can overshadow the positive aspects of the message. The post ultimately comes across as a cry for help, but the way it is written may not be the most effective way to elicit sympathy or support from others."

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

While the post expresses feelings of sadness and despair, it does not explicitly exhibit signs of thwarted belongingness. The user acknowledges the negative news they received and their current mental and physical state, but they also emphasize the sense of community and support they feel from the comments and well-wishes of others.

**Here's a breakdown of the post:**

* **Self-disclosure:** The user openly shares their feelings of feeling ""shit mentally and physically"" and being ""terrified."" This vulnerability can be seen as a sign of trust and openness, which can foster belonging.

* **Community engagement:** The user encourages others to share their experiences and expresses appreciation for the comments that have alleviated their depressive thoughts and anxiety. This engagement creates a sense of community and belonging.

* **Self-deprecation:** The user's language (""I feel like shit"") might be seen as self-deprecating and could contribute to feelings of inadequacy.
* **Over-reliance on others:** The user's reliance on others to alleviate their depressive thoughts and anxiety might be unhealthy and could lead to dependence on others for emotional well-being.

**Overall, while the post does not explicitly show risk of thwarted belongingness, there are some potential concerns that should be monitored.** It is important to remember that this post is a snapshot of the user's experience and does not necessarily represent their overall well-being or mental health. If the user experiences persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or self-doubt, it is important to seek professional help or reach out to a trusted friend or family member."

## Analysis

This post does show some risk of thwarted belongingness, although not necessarily to the same extent as other posts. Here's why:

**Potential for exclusion:**

* The post mentions a ""quirky unfortunate coincidence,"" which could imply that the author feels their experience is unique and different from others. This could make others feel excluded or like their experiences are not as valid.
* The use of the word ""unfortunate"" also carries a negative connotation, implying that the author feels their experience is unlucky and undesirable. This could make others feel like they don't want to share similar experiences or that they should not be unlucky.

**However, there are also mitigating factors:**

* The post does not explicitly exclude or marginalize anyone. It simply shares the author's personal experience and does not make generalizations or assumptions about others.
* The tone of the post is more humorous than solemn, and the author acknowledges the quirkiness of their experience. This could help to alleviate the sense of exclusion or misfortune.

**Overall, the risk of thwarted belongingness in this post is moderate.** While the post does have some elements that could make others feel excluded or unlucky, the mitigating factors and the overall tone of the post help to reduce that risk.

**Additional factors to consider:**

* The audience of the post: If the post is targeted towards a specific group of people, the risk of thwarted belongingness may be higher.
* The context of the post: If the post is part of a larger conversation or community, the risk of thwarted belongingness may be lower.

"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: The given post expresses concerns about recovering from depression and doubts about liking the new version of oneself. However, it does not directly mention any feelings of inadequacy in terms of belongingness or lack of connectedness. It focuses more on concerns about personal identity and the recovery process.

## Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Yes, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness. The author expresses concern about not fitting in with others due to their potential changes in personality after recovering from depression. They question whether they will like the new version of themselves and fear that taming their mental illness might lead to a dislike of their current self. This fear is rooted in a misconception about depression and its impact on personality. While depression can affect mood, behavior, and thinking patterns, it does not necessarily alter a person's core personality. Recovery from depression involves addressing the underlying factors that contributed to the depression and developing coping mechanisms to manage symptoms. It does not necessarily involve significant changes to a person's personality.

The author's concern about not liking themselves after recovery is understandable, but it is important to remember that recovery is a process that involves personal growth and self-acceptance. It is not a destination where one becomes a different person. Rather, it is a journey towards a more fulfilling and happier life. The author's experience is valid, and it is important to acknowledge the challenges and fears that people with depression may have about recovery. However, it is important to remember that recovery is possible, and that it is possible to live a fulfilling life after overcoming depression."
"No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does mention depression, which is a mental disturbance and can be a risk factor for perceived burdensomeness.

The primary concern expressed is about the potential outcome of recovering from depression and not liking the new version of oneself.

2. The post also mentions the difficulty in distinguishing between the effects of mental illness and one's true personality. This may contribute to a sense of uncertainty and apprehension about the recovery process.

3. The post emphasizes the lack of access to medication or therapy and the need to create a personal plan of action. While this may indicate a lack of resources for formal treatment, it does not necessarily imply perceived burdensomeness.

Overall, the post primarily focuses on the individual's concerns about self-identity and the recovery process, rather than expressing direct signs of perceived burdensomeness.","

## Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Yes, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness. The author expresses concern about the potential negative consequences of recovering from depression, specifically the fear of not liking the new version of themselves. This fear is rooted in the belief that mental illness is a part of their personality, and that taming it will result in a fundamentally different person. This perception of burdensomeness is evident in the author's statement ""if I tame the mental illness then what if I don't like the version of me that's left?""

While the post acknowledges the challenges of recovery and the potential for personal changes, it does not delve into the specific mechanisms or strategies for coping with these challenges. The author mentions their inability to afford medication or therapy, and their current efforts to create their own plan of action. However, they do not provide details about the nature of their plan or its effectiveness.

Overall, the post demonstrates the potential risk of perceived burdensomeness associated with recovery from depression, particularly for individuals who may not have access to traditional treatment options. The author's fear of changing fundamentally as a person is understandable, and it is important to acknowledge the emotional complexity involved in recovery. However, the post does not provide sufficient information about the author's coping mechanisms or strategies for managing their fears, making it difficult to assess the full extent of their perceived burdensomeness."

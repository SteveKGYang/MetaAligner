"This post shows depression. Reasoning: While the post does not explicitly mention feelings of sadness or hopelessness, there are a few elements that suggest depression as the most likely mental disorder label:
- The author mentions witnessing their dad spending a significant amount of money on diamonds for their mom's anniversary. The statement ""learn from this"" could imply that the author's dad believes that material possessions are an important way to show love or maintain a relationship.

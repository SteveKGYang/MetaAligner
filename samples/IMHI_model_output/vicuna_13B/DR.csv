The poster acknowledges that they require professional advice but also seeks to hear about others' experiences, suggesting a personal concern or potential experience with this issue. The focus on the emotional and behavioral effects of medication aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression and bipolar disorder. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that the poster may be dealing with depression or bipolar disorder.","Based on the information provided in the post, it is difficult to determine whether the poster suffers from depression or not. The poster mentions experiencing symptoms such as trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spending money excessively, increased responsiveness to stimuli, and engaging in previously enjoyed activities, which could be indicative of both the side effects of starting an antidepressant medication and symptoms of hypomania.

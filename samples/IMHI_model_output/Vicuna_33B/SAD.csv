A post discussing life in general could remind individuals of their own struggles and add to their feelings of being overwhelmed. 3. **Comparison**: When people read posts about others' experiences or perspectives on life, they might compare their own lives and situations to those described. This comparison can lead to feelings of inadequacy or disappointment, causing stress. 4. **Lack of Control**: Some topics discussed under ""life in general"" might involve issues or circumstances beyond an individual's control (e.g., economic conditions, social problems). Feeling powerless to change these situations can contribute to increased stress levels. 5. **Emotional Triggers**: Certain conversations or stories shared within a ""life in general"" post may trigger emotional reactions, bringing up past experiences or unresolved issues.

First, there are grammatical errors that create confusion or make it difficult for readers to understand the intended meaning. Secondly, the punctuation could be improved to provide clearer structure and flow to the sentence. Here are some suggestions for reducing stress caused by these issues:  1. Grammar: The most significant error in this sentence is the use of ""a"" instead of ""an"" before the word ""freshman"". To fix this issue, simply change ""a"" to ""an"": ""I'm an freshmen at RCB.""

Punctuation: Using proper punctuation can help reduce stress by making sentences easier to read and understand.

While they briefly mention their own experiences with a dysfunctional family, they explicitly state that they do not want to focus on their own personal struggles. The tone of the post is curious and open-minded, suggesting a desire to learn and understand rather than experiencing overwhelming emotional distress.","Based solely on this text, it's difficult to definitively determine whether the poster suffers from depression or not. They do express curiosity about functional families and ask for positive experiences, which could indicate that they are seeking ways to improve their understanding of healthy relationships. However, they also mention having experiences with dysfunctional families and imply that those experiences might be prevalent among people from North America. It's important to note that experiencing dysfunctional familial relationships doesn't necessarily equate to depression; individuals may process and cope with such experiences differently.
